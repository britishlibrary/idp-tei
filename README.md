TEI in International Dunhuang Project 


### Overview
TEI is used for Catalogues (including Translations) and Bibliographies within the IDP website. The TEI XML is stored within binary blobs within the 4D database in tables [Catatalogue] and [Bibliography] respectively. 4D methods are used to call to transform elements of the TEI from the blobs into HTML for display on the website.

In this repo we store the complete set of XML TEI files extracted from the binary blobs.

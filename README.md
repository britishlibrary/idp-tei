### Overview
Within the IDP system, TEI XML is used for Catalogues (including Translations and Site Reports) and Bibliographies. The TEI XML is stored within binary blobs within the 4D database in tables [Catatalogue] and [Bibliography] respectively. 4D methods are used to call to transform elements of the TEI from the blobs into HTML for display in panels on the website.

In this repo we store the complete set of (prettified) TEI files extracted from the binary blobs, [Catalogue]XMLBlob and [Bibliography]XMLRecord. For link to an index for each type see Wiki page [./wiki/TEI-XML-files-extracted-from-4D-blobs-(plus-HTML-derived-using-XSLT)](https://github.com/britishlibrary/idp-tei/wiki/TEI-XML-files-extracted-from-4D-blobs-(plus-HTML-derived-using-XSLT))

We also store copies of the various XSL stylsheets (version 1.0) used within the 4D system for converting these to HTML on the IDP website [idp.bl.uk](idp.bl.uk). For a Wiki page see [./wiki/XSL-stylesheets](https://github.com/britishlibrary/idp-tei/wiki/XSL-stylesheets)

And we also store HTML 'panels' derived from the TEI files via XSLT - equivalent to the panels appearing on the IDP website. Again, see Wiki page [./wiki/TEI-XML-files-extracted-from-4D-blobs-(plus-HTML-derived-using-XSLT)](https://github.com/britishlibrary/idp-tei/wiki/TEI-XML-files-extracted-from-4D-blobs-(plus-HTML-derived-using-XSLT))

    <note>Leading Chinese Buddhists of the 17th century were critical of Christian doctrine as expounded by Jesuits of the China mission. These critics belonged to various Buddhist traditions - Ch'an, Pure Land, Hua-yen and T'ien-t'ai - and took issue with key tenets of Christian theology, such as the doctrines on the creation and the immortality of the soul. At the heart of thier opposition was the antagonism betwen the Buddhist idea of the Buddha-nature which permeates every being and is the cause for salvation, and the Christion idea of a transcendent God who pronounces final judgment on each individual. The present work porvides the first translations into a European language of the texts which set out the criticisms of the Chrisitan position by Chinese Buddhists of the Ming dynasty. The translations are annotated, with the Chinese texts in an appendix. An introductory essay precedes the translations.</note>

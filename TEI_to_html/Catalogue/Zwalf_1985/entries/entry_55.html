appear to be those collected in the Ratnakuta, or 'Gem heap', a collection of forty-nine separate works from different periods made before the 2nd century AD. Some had previously been translated separately into Chinese, but the collection as a whole represents the earliest Mahayana group. This scroll contains the forty-seventh work in the collection, the Ratnakutapariprccha, the Bodhisattva Ratnakuta's assembly, translated by Fa Hu of the Western Jin dynasty (AD 265-316). The paper scroll is attached to its original wooden roller and the silk tie, showing the complete form of the early 'book' in China. Various

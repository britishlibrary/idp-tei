Ink on wood in Pakrit. 5 lines of Kharosthi script. This interesting document contains a letter from two Buddhist monks, Bamgusena and Pacgoyae, addressed to the cojhbos Namtasena and Cataroyae, saying that they have heard with great sorrow of the death of Anasena, but 'that is something beyond even the powers of a Buddha, or a Pratyekabuddha, or an Arhat or a Universal Monarch. All come to the same end. Care must be exercised how we go, virtuous acts performed and purity maintained'.

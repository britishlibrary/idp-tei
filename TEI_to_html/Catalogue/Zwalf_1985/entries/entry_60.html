Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita-sutra

in Sanskrit. Upright Gupta script. The title 'Perfection of Wisdom' embraces numerous scriptures written on the twin theme of the way the Bodhisattva (the six perfections) and the doctrine of Emptiness. Some of these texts are as long as 100,000 slokas (a unit of thirty-two syllables); others as short as a few hundred (nos 64-9). The earliest of these, and perhaps the earliest of all Mahayana sutras, is this version in 8,000 slokas produced probably in Andhara in southern India in the 1st century AD. Its philosophy may be succinctly stated thus:'The nature of all phenomena (dharmas) is non-nature and their non-nature is their nature. Their one characteristic is having a non-characteristic.' Even emptiness is not a characteristic: entities are empty because they do not exist. The non-perception of these non-entities is called the Perfection of Wisdom. The Prajnaparamita was one of the earliest texts translated into Chinese, and many manuscripts were produced in Central Asia.

Manuscript in Chinese. Ink on paper roll, with part of a calendar on the reverse. This fragmentary text, entitled 'In praise of the lohan and monk Fo Tu Deng', records episodes in the life of the monk who was, like so many early Buddhist translators and teachers in China, of Central Asian origin. He arrived in north China early in the 4th century to set up a religious centre, but warfare prevented him from doing so. His magical achievements included producing a lotus from a bowl of water and drawing water from dry wells with a toothpick, but more in keeping with the Doctrine he tried to persuade rulers to eschew violence in war and government. His success as a missionary was such that 893 monasteries and temples were said to have been built at his instigation, two entire tribes of 'barbarians' were converted, and 10,000 disciples instructed by him.

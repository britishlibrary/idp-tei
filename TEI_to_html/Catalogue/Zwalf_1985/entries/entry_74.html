Vimalakirtinirdesasutra

in Sogdian, written on the reverse of a Chinese sutra. Ink on paper. The teaching of Vimalakirti is another exposition of the Emptiness doctrine. It takes the form of a conversation between the layman Vimalakirti, pretending to be ill, and the Bodhisattva Manjusri, sent by the Buddha to enquire after his health. At first the sutra is a witty account of earlier conversations between Vimalakirti and the disciples and Bodhisattvas attendant on the Buddha, all of whom have been worsted in earlier discussions through Vimalakirti's exposition of 'empty' conversation - nothing can be taken for granted because nothing is capable of ultimate confirmation - and hence refuse to go to Vimalakirti's bedside. After exchanges of this sort with Manjusri, Vimalakirti finally explains the way of the Bodhisattva in terms of the Emptiness doctrine (how the Bodhisattva lives in the world but apart from it, etc.)

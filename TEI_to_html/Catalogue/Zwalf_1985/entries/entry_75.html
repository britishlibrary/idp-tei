in Chinese. Ink on paper. This sutra has long been popular in China, the character of Vimalakirti explaining its success, for he was a brilliant conversationalist and lived in comfort though a disciplined follower of Buddha. For the Chinese who believed it essential for family members to look after each other and care for their ancestral spirits, monasticism was the antithesis of family life and worship. This sutra, with its emphasis on the layman, suited the Chinese view. The commentaries on the sutra were written by Kumarajiva and his disciples Seng Zhao (374-414), who was converted to Buddhism by this sutra, and Dao Sheng (c.360-434), who spent much time on the beutiful holy mountain of Lu Shan, and Seng Rui.

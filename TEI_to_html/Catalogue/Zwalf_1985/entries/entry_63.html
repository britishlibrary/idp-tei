in Chinese. Ink on paper. This work is a commentary by Nagarjuna II on the perfection of Wisdom in 25,000 slokas, translated by Kumarajiva (AD 384-417). Nagarjuna I, his teacher, founded the Madhyamaka, or 'Intermediate' school, which stressed a middle path between the extremes of believing in existence and non-existence. Nagarjuna II linked his master's philosophy directly with the Perfection of Wisdom texts. Through his translations Kumarajiva established the school in China where it was called the 'School of the Three Treatises'. Kumarajiva was not Chinese but half Brahmin, half Kuchean and studied Buddism in Kashmir and Kashgar. He set up a translation bureau of 1,000 monks in the Chinese capital, which translated Sanskrit works, many of them now known only in Chinese.

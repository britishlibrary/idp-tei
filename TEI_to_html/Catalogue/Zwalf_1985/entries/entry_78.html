The 
<span class="bibit">
Garland Sutra 
</span>
, one of the 
<span class="bibit">
Mahayana 
</span>
idealist sutras, appears to have been composed in the 3rd century AD.There are three Chinese translations; this is the first, made by 

Buddhabhadra 

in AD 418-20. These sutras are concerned with the Bodhisattva's quest for truth and establishing a view of the world in which all principles are related. A totalistic system is envisaged with everything leading to the centre, the Buddha. The 

Huayan 

, or 

Garland school 

, flourished in China from the early 8th to the late 9th centuries and is supposed to have been popular with the ruthless 

Empress Wu 

, as it provided a religious sanction for her totalitarian schemes.

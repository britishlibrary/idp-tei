Folding book containing 
<span class="bibit">
Prajnaparamitahrdayasutra 
</span>
in Sanskrit. Alternate columns of late Gupta (Siddham) and Chinese scripts. 18 folds, each of 5 columns. Unlike Or.8212/175, where the Soghdian transliteration is forced to accomodate the Sanskrit version, this folding book accomodates both Chinese and Sanskrit scripts perfectly. The Siddham script is written in vertical columns with a brush, lending the script some of the idiosyncrasy of Chinese calligraphy, while the Chinese characters representing the Sanskrit sounds occupy the adjacent column. The script continued to be used in China and Japan for Sanskrit, both in manuscript and block-printed forms. One of its most famous masters was the Japanese monk Jiun Sonja.

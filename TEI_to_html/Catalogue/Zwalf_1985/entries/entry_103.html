The apocryphal sutra of the Ten Kings of Hell appears to have been composed during the 10th century but probably reflects earlier ideas. It describes the ten stages through which the soul must pass after death. Of the Ten Kings who preside over the stages four are Buddhist (including Yama and the Wheelturner of the Five Gati), one is borrowed from traditional Chinese belief, and the rest are unidentifiable. The paintings in the manuscript depict the tortures of sinners. The kings and attendants are dressed as officials with black ear-flapped hats; the imagery is a mixture of traditional Chinese and Buddhist iconography.

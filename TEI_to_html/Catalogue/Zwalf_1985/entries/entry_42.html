Bound volume containing a Uyghur commentary, with some Chinese, on 

Sthriamati 

's commentary on 

Vasubandhu 

's 'Abhidharmakosa'. Ink on paper. 64 folios (each folio double). 

Vasubandhu, who lived probably in the 5th century AD, belonged to the 

Sautrantika school 

whose doctrines were based solely on the sutras, rejecting the interpretation in the Sarvastivada Abhidharma. Even the Sautrantikas, however, needed answers to the basic questions posed in the Abhidharma controversies, and Vasubandu wrote this extremely influential work on the basis of the Hinayana Sutrapitaka. 
<br>
The Uyghurs, Turks from the north of the Tianshan, built an empire in western China in the late 1st millennium AD, including Dunhuang. Although found in the walled-up library, this and other late volumes were added by the priest-in-charge between the discovery in 1900 and Stein's visit in 1907.

Folio from a pothi manuscript in Sanskrit. Indian Gupta script. Ink on a chalk ground on silk. In Central Asia Indian tradition was adapted to suit new languages and manuscript materials. Paper, used in China since the 1st century AD, was widespread in Central Asia probably by the 3rd century. Silk also was an ancient Chinese writing material. This single folio is the only known example of a Sanskrit silk manuscript cut to Pothi shape. It was covered with a chalk ground and the script was written with a pen. This does not suit the material (which the Chinese wrote on with a soft brush) as much of the chalk has lifted off taking the writing with it. The scribe, writing writing in Indian Gupta script, was perhaps unfamiliar with the usual method. The folio was found below a niche, once apparently containing a statue, surrounding the base of a brick stupa inside the fort at Bash-Koyumal.

Vajracchedika Prajnaparamitasutra

in Chinese. 4 pages of drawings. The Vajracchedika in Kumarajiva's translation was one of the most popular texts in 7th-century Dunhuang judging from the number Stein collected there; it comes second only to the Lotus Sutra. In it Sakyamuni Buddha instructs his disciple Subhuti in the Perfection of Wisdom. This booklet with its rather crude drawings of Bodhisattvas and Lokapalas (World-protectors) represents a stage in the development of the Chinese book, beyond the scroll form. The later traditional book in China consisted of thin leaves folded at the outer margin, but the booklets from Dunhuang are generally written on very thick paper sewn at the inner margin.

of the Pure Land school (which began in China in the early 5th century and was later exported to Japan) is the Sukhavativyuha which exists in a long and a short version. There are several translations of both; this is an example of the shorter version, the Amitayuhsutra, translated by a Soghdian, Kang Senhui (or Samghavarman), in AD 252. Both versions contain detailed descriptions of the Pure Land, or Paradise of Amitabha (in the east in Sanskrit and Khotanese, in the west in Chinese). Rebirth in the Pure Land results from meritorious deeds combined with faith and devotion to Amitabha in the longer version, faith and prayer alone in the shorter version.

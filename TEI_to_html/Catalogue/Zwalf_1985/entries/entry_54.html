of Matrctea in Sanskrit. Slanting Gupta script. Ink on paper. 

Hymns in praise (stotra) of the divine characterise both Hinduism and Buddhism from about the 1st century AD. Even in the Hinayana the Buddha's development of a super-human, transcendent personality made such hymns possible. The most famous Buddhist hymn-writer wa Matcrceta (2nd century AD) who seems to have worshipped Siva before becoming a Buddhist. He is supposed to have been converted by Aryadeva, disciple of Nagarjuna.

The simple beauty of these Sanskrit hymns appealed to Hinayanists and Mahayanists alike, as for example: 'Revilers have you overcome by mildness, the malicious by making them secure, liars by the truth and the malevolent by your friendship" (v.122). Such non-sectarian sentiments were ideally suited to communal chanting in monasteries where monks of both persuasions dwelt together.

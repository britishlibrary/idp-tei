in Chinese, 25th section. Ink on paper, with coloured illustrations. The Lotus Sutra outnumbers all others brought back from Dunhuang by Stein. The most popular section was the 25th which describes how a person in distress, threatened by fire, thieves or drowning, can be saved by calling on the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, whose name is translated into Chinese as 'The one who hears the cries of the world' (Guanshiyin). This booklet illustrates the earliest stage of what was to become an immensley popular form of book production, particularly with the enormous development of printing in the early Ming (1368-1644), where each page contains both text and illustration.

in Sanskrit. Alternate lines of late Gupta (Siddham) and Soghdian scripts. Ink on paper. A dharani in honour of Avalokitesvara as Nilakantha, blue-throated, a sobriquet borrowed from the Hindu god Siva. The Gupta script has been influenced by later developments (post-Gupta) in India itself; the Soghdian is not a translation but a transliteration of the Sanskrit sounds into the Soghdian alphabet, which is derived from Estrangela Syriac, brought to Central Asia by the Nestorian Christians. Since Soghdian is written in vertical columns, the scribe, who wrote both scripts but allowed his native Soghdian to influence his spelling of Sanskrit, had to turn the scroll through a quater circle at the beginning of each Soghdian line. Soghdian colonies existed in Xinjiang during the Tang dynasty, and the paper used in the Soghdian manuscripts resembles that of the Chinese manuscripts found at Dunhuang of the Tang period. Some Soghdian translations also seem to be taken from the Chinese. The evidence therefore suggests that the Dunhuang Soghdian manuscripts were local products rather than far away Soghdiana (western Turkistan between Oxus and Jaxartes).

Kumarajiva and Xuanzang are the most famous early translators and teachers in Chinese Buddhism. Kumarajiva (AD 344-c.413) as born in Kucha of a Brahmin father and a Kuchean princess. His fame was such that rulers in different parts of China competed to possess him at court and he was held a virtual prisoner by a general in Kucha for seventeen years. He was a stylish and innovative translator who tried to produce an elegant version faithful to the text. He believed that no translation could capture the flavour of the original and is supposed to have said that reading the sutras in translation was like eating rice that someone else had already chewed.

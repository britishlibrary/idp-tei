Scroll manuscript of

Abhiniskramanasutra 
</span>
in Chinese. Ink on paper. 

This sutra, translated by Jnanagupta of the Sui dynasty (c. 589-618), is a biography of the Buddha associated with the Dharmagupta school which was most active in promoting Buddhism in Central Asia and China. Its tradition lived on in the rules of discipline for religious communities after the introduction of the Mahayana. 
<br>
The stupa cult was also introduced by the Dharmagupta school with which this sutra is associated, and Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty put up 111 stupas between 601 and 604 to house relics, in deliberate imitation of Asoka.

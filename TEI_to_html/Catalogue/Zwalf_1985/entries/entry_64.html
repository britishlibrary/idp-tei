Incomplete pothi manuscript of 
<span class="bibit">
Satasahasrika Prajnaparamitasutra 
</span>
in Sanskrit. Late Gupta script. Ink on palm leaves. 69 folios. Among the most precious relics found at Dunhuang was a large palm-leaf manuscript of the longest recension of the Prajnaparamita, which must have originally been written in northern India before undertaking its perilous journey to Dunhuang, perhaps through Tibet as this was the period of the Tibetan occupation of Dunhuang. The manuscript must originally have contained some 1,000 folios. Dated to 8th century AD.

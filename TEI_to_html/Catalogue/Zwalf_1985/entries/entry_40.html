Wooden board, perhaps part of a wooden pothi manuscript, with inked inscription of Vinaya texts in Prakrit. Kharosthi script. Most of the numerous wooden documents found at Niya in Kharosthi characters (a north-west Indian script derived from Aramaic and found mostly in Gandhara and the Panjab) are official missives in Prakrit. This board, however, contains a Vinaya text. It extols the performance of a certain bathing ritual, and the blessing conferred thereby even on the bath attendants. Its purpose is not clear, nor the reason for its being in an archive of official documents in the local magistrate's house.

From a stupa at Khadalik. 8th century AD. Two fragments of a pothi manuscript of Prajnaparamita in Sanskrit. Upright Gupta script. Ink and gouache on paper. Roundel originally 5.5cm diamter. The seated Buddha is a larger version of that in the Aparimitayuhsutra [57], but corresponding to that in the Vajracchedika [66] in position. The Indian-script manuscripts with miniatures or illuminations found in Central Asia are all either in the Iranian language Khotanese or found in the Iranianised districts of south-western Xinjiang near Khotan itself. The ancient Iranians loved richly illuminated manuscripts, and explored the decorative possibilities of the large roundels found in Indian manuscripts. The roundels can serve as chapter markers, which sometimes are elaborately drawn dharmacakras. As so few surviving Central Asian manuscripts have decorations of this sort, it would seem that illumination was rarely attempted. The reason lies perhaps in a respect for the calligraphic austerity of the original Indian models. This is the only extant illustrated manuscript from the Khotan area, all the others being from Dunhuang.

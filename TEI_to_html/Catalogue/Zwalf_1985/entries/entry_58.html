in Chinese. Ink on paper. The Middle Way, rejecting doctrinal extremes, is associated with Nagarjuna (2nd century AD). It was introduced into China through Kumarajiva's translations and Seng Zhao's interpretations. Seng Zhao continued Nagarjuna's arguments on Emptiness and the unreality of all forms of existence. In his essay 'Prajna is not knowledge' he expresses ideas approaching Chinese Daoist philosophy which also stresses the Middle Way, and closeness to Taoism is sometimes cited as one of the reasons for the success of the Madhyamaka doctrines in 4th- and 5th-century China.

Scroll of alphabet and syllabaries of cursive Gupta on reverse of Chinese scroll. Ink on paper. The 'cursive' Gupta of Central Asia was a hand developed in the Khotan region from the upright form for secular use. In the walled-up library at Dunhuang several rolls like this were found with syllabaries of the cursive script. Though far from Khotan, the phonology of the syllabaries indicates that they were written by Khotanese scribes. Such syllabaries are described in Xuan Zang and other sources as xi tan xhang, ie. siddham sections. The work begins with the Sanskrit alphabet, and the syllabary proper consists of each consonant in combination with the twelve vowels, followed by a variable number of sections of ligatures (consonant clusters), each with the twelve vowels. Each section (xhang) in this scroll begins with the word siddham (perfect, or auspicious) which is the name by which the indian Gupta script became known on China and Japan.

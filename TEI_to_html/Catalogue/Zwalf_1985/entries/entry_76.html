Pothi manuscript of 
<span class="bibit">
Suvarnaprabhasasutra 
</span>
in Khotanese. Upright Gupta script. The Suvarnaprabhasasutra continues the ideas on Emptiness of the Prajnaparamita and on the eternality of the Buddha from the Lotus Sutra, but introduces many Hindu gods and goddesses, all anxious to advance Buddhism. The idea of the mantra, the charm for warding off evil and magically gaining one's desires, is advanced, as is material reward for the promulgation of this particular sutra. Such ideas were to develop into the Vajrayana. The manuscript contains roundels with coloured and uncoloured dharmacakras, intermediary perhaps between uncoloured dharmacakras and roundels enclosing pictures of the Buddha.

, Xinjiang, China. 
<span class="bibit">
Pothi 
</span>
manuscript of 
<span class="bibit">
Samyuktagama 
</span>
in Sanskrit. Fragments of 15 folios. Gupta script. Ink on birch bark. The Samyuktagama is the Sanskrit version of the 
<span class="bibit">
Samyuttanikaya 
</span>
, the third of the four Pali books of the Buddha's sermons. It owes its name to the grouping of its sutras. The Pali version which, unlike the Sanskrit, is complete, comprises 2,889 sutras. This 

Sarvastivada 

version was known only in Chinese and Tibetan until parts were discovered in 

Central Asia 

. This now fragmentary manuscript was written in the 

Himalayan region 

on birch bark, the usual writing material for that area, before being taken to Central Asia.

in Chinese. Ink on paper, folding book format. This Mulasarvastivada sutra provides exercises for monks. It covers much basic doctrine emphasising 'self-possession' achieved by observing the body, sensations, thought and phenomena to eliminate desire and cultivate aversion from the world. It was translated by Prajnaruci in AD539. The folding-book format illustrates the first development beyond the paper scroll, towards the traditional printed book with its folded leaves.

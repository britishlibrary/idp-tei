Crossing to the island of Lanka, c. 7th cent. AD. The sutra was translated by Gunabhadra in 443 but is particularly associated in China with one of the later schools, the Chan (Japanese Zen), traditionally founded by Bodhidharma who sat in front of a wall for nine years in the early 6th century. The Lankavatarasutra is named after its setting in Sri Lanka, and its subject is the Doctrine of Inner Enlightenment, accepting Consciousness as the only existent principle. Transcendence of mental discriminations is made possible by the presence in everyone of the embryo of the future Buddha. A Chan, or Zen, aspect is that comunication of ideas is not necessarily verbal.

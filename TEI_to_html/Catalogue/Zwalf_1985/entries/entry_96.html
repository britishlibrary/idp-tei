Manuscript in Chinese. Ink on paper. Thirty-six works, mostly shorter Mahayana texts, were supposed to have been translated by Zhi Qian between AD 220 and 252. These included a version of the Dharmapada and one of the Vimalakirtinirdesasutra, both of which survive. Though his family had lived in China for some generations, Zhi Qian was of Central Asian origin. He worked closely with an Indian master Vighna, particularly on their new version of the Dharmapada, in which the preface, usually attributed to Zhi Qian, raises the question of how Buddhist texts should be translated. The alternatives were faithful, literal and perhaps inelegant, the style advocated by Vighna, or a more polished version attractive to the literate Chinese public, which was Zhi Qian's method and the one favoured in the better-known translations of Xuanzang.

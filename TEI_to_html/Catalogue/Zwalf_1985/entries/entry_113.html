Fragments of a pothi manuscript of Salistambasutra in Tibetan. This sutra is a Mahayana restatement of Dependent Origination (Pratityasamutpada), on the analogy of the rice plant from the seed to the grain. The fragments of 15 folios of the Salistambasutra were found before images round the Buddhist temple at Endere, deposited to propiate the divinities. They must date from the Tibetan occupation of this part of Xinjiang and before the temple was abandoned in the mid-8th century. The manuscript was almost certainly written not in Xinjiang but in Tibet, as it uses daphne fibres. Daphne species grow in the high Himalaya and the Tibetan plateau and were early used by Nepalese and Tibetans for paper manufacture. These and other Tibetan fragments found at Endere represent the earliest known Tibetan manuscripts, scarcely a century after the introduction of the script.

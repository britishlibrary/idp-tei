     This catalogue is based on the exhibition "Aurel Stein: A hundred years on" by The
            British Library, the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) and the University of
            Nottingham (6 January – 14 February 2014). There is an online version of the exhibition
                <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/events/RGS2014/intro.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The exhibition
            marks IDP20, the twentieth anniversary celebrations of the International Dunhuang
            Project (IDP) at the British Library. IDP is an international collaboration which is
            currently making over 400,000 images of manuscripts, paintings and artefacts discovered
            at Eastern Silk Road sites freely available online, along with historical and modern
            photographs, plans, maps and explorers’ archives. The exhibition was curated and
            designed by Vic Swift, with the assistance of John Falconer, Josef Konczak and Susan
            Whitfield. <p> Introduction</p>
            <p> The Silk Road has become a popular name for the network of long-distance land and
                maritime trade routes that connected Europe, Africa and Asia from the end of the
                first millennium BC. This exhibition focuses on the eastern part of these routes, in
                what is now western China: the Tarim Basin.</p>
            <p> The archaeologist M. Aurel Stein (1862–1943) coined the term ‘Serindia’ for this
                region, ‘which for close on a thousand years formed the special meeting ground of
                Chinese civilization, introduced by trade and political penetration, and of Indian
                culture, propagated by Buddhism.’</p>
            <p> Stein led four expeditions to western China between 1900 and 1930, excavating at
                scores of sites and discovering hundreds of thousands of artefacts. His extensive
                photographic record of over 5000 images is now mostly held in the British
                Library.</p>
            <p> In 2008 and 2011 teams from the International Dunhuang Project (IDP) at the British
                Library and the Xinjiang Institute of Archaeology (XJIA) led joint field trips to
                revisit and document the sites visited by Stein to record the changes of the past
                century.</p>
            <p> This exhibition shows a selection of historical and modern photographs of farming
                settlements (first to fourth c.), Buddhist temples (fifth to sixth c.) and Tibetan
                forts (eighth to ninth c.), as well as something of life today in the towns and
                villages of the Taklamakan.</p>
            <p>Tibetan Forts</p>
            <p> The empires surrounding the Tarim all sought control of the region and its trade
                routes. In the mid-eighth century the Tibetan Empire moved northward into the Tarim
                Basin, following the withdrawal of Chinese forces owing to civil war in central
                China. The Tibetans built military forts at strategic positions.</p>
            <p> Mazar Tagh fort stands on a bluff overlooking the Khotan river on a route through
                the Taklamakan. It guarded the northern boundaries of Khotan. Miran fort is on the
                site of an older settlement of the Krorainan kingdom and protected the routes along
                the southern Taklamakan and south to the Tibetan plateau. Endere fort also guards
                the route south.</p>
            <p> About a century later when the Tibetan armies withdrew, the forts were abandoned,
                along with the rubbish heaps left by the soldiers. Stein’s excavations uncovered
                over a thousand Tibetan documents on wood and paper. He also unearthed broken
                armour, spear heads, bags and other discarded artefacts. These offer a glimpse into
                the life of Tibetan soldiers at this time.</p>
            <p>Buddhist Stupas</p>
            <p>The stupa, originating in India in about the third century B.C., was a funerary mound
                covering relics of the historical Buddha or his disciples. Its function widened over
                the following centuries: some house objects used by the Buddha or his disciples,
                some commemorate actions or events in the life of the Buddha and his disciples,
                while others symbolize aspects of Buddhist theology or are built as shrines on
                important places. The stupa was a focus for ritual and worship, including
                circumambulation.</p>
            <p>The original form was a dome on a circular base. As Buddhism spread north then east
                from India, across the Pamir into the Tarim, the stupa developed into several
                distinctive and more complex new forms. The base became square and stepped, with
                staircases on one or all four sides. The dome became elongated and more
                tower-like.</p>
            <p>All these forms are seen in the Taklamakan, the earliest probably dating to the
                second and third centuries (at Miran and Niya), and continuing throughout the first
                millennium (at Endere and Rawak). They are evidence of substantial Buddhist
                communities and considerable wealth.</p>
            <p>Road Settlements</p>
            <p>The soil of the Taklamakan is fertile and with irrigation it can support extensive
                agriculture. The southern oasis towns on the alluvial piedmont were dependent for
                their livelihood on the spring and summer meltwater from the mountains. Water was
                channeled through complex irrigation systems and stored in tanks for winter
                supplies.</p>
            <p>The site of Cadota (Niya) was a thriving community from the first to the fourth
                century, becoming part of the larger kingdom of Kroraina by the third century.
                Farmsteads lined the Niya River for over 25 km into the Taklamakan Desert. Their
                residents cultivated orchards and vineyards, as well as keeping large herds of
                livestock.</p>
            <p>Their substantial houses were built with frames made from local poplar wood, and
                these are often all that remains of them today. But objects discarded when the
                settlements were deserted provide a picture of life in these settlements. Also left
                behind were legal and administrative archives: manuscripts written on wood and
                leather in the Gandharan Prakrit language.</p>
            <p>Karadong was on the route across the Taklamakan which followed the Keriya River. Here
                Stein discovered houses and a large rectangular complex that is now identified as a
                fortified post.</p>
            <p>Landscape</p>
            <p>Tamarisk cones are a ubiquitous and striking feature of the Taklamakan — mounds
                formed where the dense roots of this plant have prevented the sand from blowing
                away. It is remarkable how little these have changed since Stein’s day: many of our
                shots were matched using these natural landmarks. Even though water courses have
                changed, flash floods from summer melt in the surrounding mountains sometimes cause
                long dormant seeds to sprout, as in the ancient riverbed at Niya. Over many seasons
                the receding waters leave behind clay layers which, like the tamarisk cones, stand
                proud of the surrounding sand.</p>
            <p> Around the existing rivers there are still forests of white and black poplars, while
                their desiccated ancestors emerge from the desert dunes. The wood continues to be
                used for building, while leaves and sap have many other uses, including as a yellow
                dye, a medicine and soap. The reeds growing in the riverbeds are also harvested and
                used as fences for the animal pens. Around the abandoned desert settlements, the
                dried remains of mulberry trees attest the former fertility of these now arid
                regions.</p>
            <p>Travel</p>
            <p>Crossing the Tarim Basin is a journey not only across space but also back in time.
                Travelling on foot and on horseback, Stein had to surmount the formidable mountain
                ranges between India and China to reach his starting point, Kashgar. Our starting
                point at Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, is nowadays reached easily by plane. But
                as we moved further away from Urumqi, we moved closer to Stein and other travellers
                of the past.</p>
            <p> At first, the difference remains considerable, with wide roads and a railway now
                crossing the mountains and skirting the deserts. On the modern road which now
                bisects the Taklamakan, grids of netting keep the constantly shifting sands at bay.
                The sites at the fringes of the desert can be reached in some comfort and speed by
                4-wheel drives — with skilful driving.</p>
            <p> Further into the desert, sand trucks, driven by off-duty oil workers, track a slow
                and circuitous path, searching for navigable routes through the mountainous dunes.
                But even they cannot negotiate the deepest sands of the Taklamakan. Here Bactrian
                camels come into their own and the pace of the journey reduces to that of Stein a
                century ago and, indeed, to that of Silk Road merchants two millennia past.</p>
            <p>Camp and Work</p>
            <p>Working and sleeping in the desert has probably not changed in essentials since
                Stein’s day. At remote sites such as Niya and Karadong all supplies have to be taken
                in, including water: Stein’s camels carried large blocks of ice to see him through
                excavations in the desert winters. His provisions included powdered soups, marmite
                and, for a treat, Cadbury’s chocolate. He ate and worked at night, as we did, by the
                light of bonfires fed with the wood of ancient forests.</p>
            <p>What has changed is the portability of equipment, with digital cameras, GPS, solar
                chargers and lightweight tents. Stein had to carry large cameras, glass plates and
                developing equipment for his photography, a plane table for his surveying and heavy
                canvas tents — although he also had the luxury of a Willesden Green Circular Canvas
                Bath and a folding table and chair.</p>
            <p>Today, the local guides and camel men still ply the same trade and many probably come
                from the same families. Indeed, the custodian at Niya and our guide to the site in
                2011 recognized his relative in one of Stein’s photographs.</p>
            <p>Local Life</p>
            <p>A century ago, when Stein travelled, the towns and villages fringing the Tarim were
                built in typically Central Asian style. Single-storey, flat-roofed adobe courtyard
                houses flanked the poplar-lined dirt roads. Irrigation channels ran alongside
                feeding the orchards and fields. The local magistrate usually had a larger house
                within its own garden — Stein often pitched his tent here.</p>
            <p>Today the hearts of the old towns struggle to survive, increasingly hidden by new
                town centres with grids of paved roads, multi-storey apartments, offices and shops.
                Many towns now also have new museums displaying the finds from recent archaeological
                activity. Further into the desert the village houses remain the same, with the
                addition of electricity and TVs.</p>
            <p>Trade continues as it has done for millennia. Each county town has its market day and
                bazaars with villagers travelling in on donkey cart, motorbike and on foot. Food
                still punctuates life, just as it did in Stein’s day, and banquets with local
                officials are an essential part of work.</p>

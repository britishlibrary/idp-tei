            This is one of seven banners, whole or fragmentary, made on the same pattern (the others are not in the British Museum). Like the two preceding banners, it is made up of panels of silk, without a painted representation. Some of the banners had tail streamers of dark brown silk. The headpiece and one of the panels are of printed silk, but there are differences between them, in spite of the similarity of their motifs. The headpiece is made of a folded square of plain white silk with large squared flowers based on a central four-petalled floret, surrounded by three ranks of florets, each with three visible petals. The whole motif is quite large, nearly 14 cm square. Its irregular disposition over the silk and the fact that the ground is not coloured tempt me to suggest that each motif was separately printed. All the petals would first have been printed in indigo blue; a second block produced the yellow centers for the central floret for the outer row of florets, and for two florets on each side in the middle row, at the same time making their petals green; finally, touches of red were printed on top of the yellow and in the centres of the remaining eight florets. This red was rather fugitive and only pale traces of it remain. The same technique seems to have been used for the border seen in Pl. 16.<br>
            In the printed panel, the pattern is made up of squared florets, each with a cruciform flower at the centre. Because these motifs are reserved on a rose ground, it is hard to see how they could have been individually printed, and this suggests that the jiaxie technique (see Pls. 13-20) may have been used.<br>

            此幡是圖案基本相同，或完整或斷片的七件幡之一（其他的沒有收藏在大英博物館）。和上兩圖的幡一樣，幡身由絹拼接而成，沒有繪畫。七件中，有幾件上帶有深褐色絹的幡腳。另外，每件的幡頭和幡身的面使用著印花絹，图案相似，實際的紋樣卻稍有差別。幡頭是將方形纹樣的印花絹對折而成，其紋樣構成，是以中央四瓣的小花，周圍配方形排列的三層三瓣花。這是最大的圖案，是邊長14釐米左右的方形。對絹沒有規律的處理，底沒有染色，使我產生了每個圖案是分別印染的。染色時，首先，是將所有花瓣都染成藍色，接下來是將中央的花芯和外側行中的花芯以及正中各行的每兩個花芯染成黃色，同時，把正中間行的花瓣上也加黃色成爲綠色。最後，黃色上加紅色筆道，剩下的八個小花中心也加了紅色。這種紅易褪色，只留下淡淡的痕迹。圖16展示的絹繪的邊絹，可能也用了與此相同的技法。<br>
            幡身使用的印花絹的紋樣，是中央配飾十字形小花。這種圖案是在玫瑰紅底子上充分印染，很難判別其各個顔色是如何染上的。可能是使用了夾纈（參照圖13～20）的技法。<br>

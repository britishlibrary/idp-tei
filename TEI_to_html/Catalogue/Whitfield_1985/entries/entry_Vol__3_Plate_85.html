            From Gaochang<br>
            Silk embroidery<br>
            L. 22.0 cm<br>

            Stein began his explorations of the large ruined town of Gaochang, near Turfan, in January 1915. As large-scale diggings were not possible, owing to preparations for spring sowing in the local villages, he concentrated on trial diggings that would give him some idea of the conditions in which finds brought by villagers might have been discovered. For one of these trials he chose a large ruined stupa, conspicuous in a group of tombs outside the north-east corner of the walled city. Its circular chamber, once domed, was enclosed by a thick wall outside which was a narrow passage, lit by windows in an outer wall, and containing fine fragments of wall painting.<br>
            The beautifully worked slipper shown in this plate was one of a pair discovered in this passage near a hoard of metal objects, which had been deposited there when the passage was already partly filled with fallen debris. The hoard contained metal objects of everyday use and sixty-one Chinese copper coins of the Tang and Song dynasties, the latest being of the Chongning period (A.D. 1102-7), providing an approximate date for the deposit in the first quarter of the twelfth century.<br>
            The slipper is joined down the centre at the heel and toe and is made up of many superimposed layers of fabric, the sole being constructed of layers of hemp cloth, tightly quilted like the rest of the slipper. The colours, still good, must originally have been much brighter, particularly the red that is now almost entirely faded.<br>

            斯坦因於1915年1月開始對吐魯番近郊高昌故城進行調查。附近村落正臨近春種時節，無法進行大規模的發掘。他一方面期待村民把自己發現的出土物拿出來，一方面試著進行發掘。他選的一個試掘場所，就是位於故城外側東北方向的古墓群上聳立的大廢塔。曾被圓蓋罩住的此建築物內部，房間被圓形的厚牆圍住，其外側有狹窄的通道，從建築物外牆上打開的窗戶來獲得光照，通道裏殘留著漂亮的壁畫斷片。<br>
            本圖展示的做工非常精美的履，是從此遺迹發現的一對履中的一隻。據說通道的一部分被崩塌物埋沒，在後面有金屬類堆積物附近發現的。那些金屬類除了日常用具外，還有61枚唐、宋時期的銅幣。最晚的是有崇寧年號（1102～1107年）的，說明其被埋在這裏的年代是在12世紀的第一個四分之一期。<br>
            此履，是把布疊成幾層，在鞋尖和鞋跟中央縫合，底子是用麻布疊成幾層後密密縫衲，成爲拖鞋底般硬。其顔色直到現在都保留得很好，褪色顯著的紅色等，當時無疑更鮮豔。<br>

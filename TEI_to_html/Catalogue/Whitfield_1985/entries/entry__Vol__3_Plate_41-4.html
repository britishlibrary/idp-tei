            (41-1, 41-2) This small triangular fragment is shown here from both sides. The very fine weft (Stein describes this as the warp, but it is almost certainly the weft) can be seen along one edge; the warp is broader. The front is in 2/1 twill and the back in plain weave. With such a small fragment it is not possible to reconstruct the original intricate and stylized pattern.<br>
            (41-3) According to Stein’s description, these three fragments formed a strip from the back of a Buddhist devotional handbook printed in A.D. 949. The fabric itself must have been quite old when it was so used. The design is based on Sasanian pearled medallions within which are branched square palmettes apparently arranged in threes. The left-hand fragment shows a selvedge, tightly woven, with cut ends of which a few turn. The direction of the warp in the other two fragments is t right angles to this one.<br>
            (41-4) This very fine piece would seem to be earlier than most of the textiles found at Dunhuang, with the exception of the double cloths seen in Pls. 37 and 38. Stein found three fragments of which the British Museum’s piece (shown here) is the largest. It is a twill on the front and plain weave on the back.<br>
            It is primarily the resemblance of the design to some larger, now fairly well-known fragments from Xinjiang province that suggests an early date. One such was excavated at Astana near Turfan in 1959 from tomb no. 303, with a date in the Eastern Jin corresponding to A.D. 551. It has a decoration based on a tree motif in red on bands of white, green and blue. A small chequerboard pattern in white appears in the centre of each tree, very much in the fashion of the arc of four small white rectangles found on each petal in the Stein piece. Larger pieces complete with selvedge have also been found at Turfan (cf. the set of postcards issued by the Wenwu Press). The petals are described as “hearts” by Stein, but they can hardly have been so interpreted by those who made and used this silk. The base of each petal is in a different colour: bright blue and rose pink here, and, according to Stein’s description, myrtle green in one of the other fragments.<br>
            (41-5, upper fragment) The weft here is of fine pink stiffened silk, the warp broader (Stein describes the fine stiffened silk as the warp). Enough remains of the design to show that it consisted of rows of large circles, about 15 cm in diameter, with four- armed lozenge-shaped floral spots between them. The centre of each spot is in red and light green, edged in yellow. From it spring trefoil petals in red and white, and beyond these there are four trefoil leaves again in red and light green and edged in yellow.<br>
            (41-5, lower fragment) This fragment formed the suspension loop for a banner headpiece illustrated in Serindia, Pl. LXII. The weave is 2/1 twill on the front and plain weave on the back. The weft is a soft golden yellow.<br>
            The design, on an indigo ground, is of rows of six-petalled rosettes; rows are alternately pale pink or bright orange-red. A pair of ducks faces each of the paler rosettes, holding a garland from which a flower springs and a leaf drops. Another garland hangs between them from their breasts, and from it depends the lozenge-shaped base on which they stand, with double loop and streamers below that. The ducks themselves are, as Stein observed, “admirably life-like”: their heads, breast-patches and tails are in orange-red, with the rest in yellow and white, and markings of the same indigo (described as “myrtle-green” by Stein) as the ground. By this variety and subtlety of markings, they are related to the other designs with pairs of ducks in the collection, such as the tiny but very bright ducks in the patchwork altar cloth and those of another fabric in the same patchwork (Pl. 9-7).<br>
            (41-6) The design in this fragment, which has a 3/1 twill on the front and plain weave on the back, is similar to that found on the printed fabric along the rear of a previous patchwork (see Pl. 9, No. 15). In the present piece, one row of spots is preserved almost completely: around the edge of each are eight trilobate petal shapes, alternately green and blue. The spots in alternate rows are incomplete but must have been lozenge-shaped with four instead of eight arms ending in similar trilobate petal shapes supported on volutes. More elaborate forms, as noted by Stein, appear in Chinese silver and in Chinese textiles in the Shoso-in, while ceiling patterns in the Tang caves at Dunhuang offer almost endless variations based on similar elements. Some of the closest comparisons can be made with Tang silks found at Astana (e.g., Sichou zhilu Pls. 43-44, from a tomb dated A.D. 778).<br>

            圖41－1和圖41－2分別是三角形小斷片的正反面。沿著垂直邊可看到極細的緯線（斯坦因把它當作了經線，確切的應該是緯線），經線使用比它粗的線。正面是三枚綾，反面是平織。因是斷片很小，不可能復原出它的整體纹樣。<br>
            圖41－3中展示的三件斷片，據斯坦因所記，是貼在有乾祐二年（949年）紀年的木版佛經冊裏的。但此錦本身不用說是早期織物，可能是古布的再利用。<br>
            圖案是以薩珊波斯風格的聯珠圓紋爲基礎，其中配有三個帶枝的方形花紋。左邊斷片的端脫落成鋸齒狀，但還能見到織邊，可以確認是經錦。<br>
            圖41－4是非常美的斷片，在敦煌發現的織物中，也僅次於圖37、圖38中所展示的經錦，可以說是非常早期的作品。斯坦因發現的三件斷片中，這裏展示的斷片是最大的，現收藏于大英博物館。面是綾織，反面是平織。<br>
            紋樣的基本結構，與人們所知的中國新疆地區出土的若干件早期的較大作品相似。其中之一，是1959年從吐魯番阿斯塔那303號墓（有推斷爲551年的墓誌）發掘出來的斷片，白、綠、青色帶紋上用紅色織出了樹紋。各種樹的中央用白色加了小的棋盤格紋，這與本圖斷片的各個花瓣上，以弓形排列的白色小方形的狀況相似。從吐魯番還發現了幾件有織邊的較大斷片（參照《文物精華》二）。斯坦因的記錄中，把花瓣紋稱作“心形”，那是織此錦並使用的人們的不同理解。花瓣基部使用了不同顔色，這裏的是隔行配着亮青色和紅色，據斯坦因的記述，別的斷片中還有綠色。<br>
            圖41－5上方的斷片，緯線是細而結實的淡紅色，而經線則是粗線（斯坦因的記述中細而結實的線是經線）。其圖案構成，從殘存的紋樣完全能推斷出，是由直徑約15釐米的大圓排成列，其間連接圓的四方形中配三葉紋的菱形紋樣。點紋的中心加了紅和淡綠，周圍用黃色做邊。其外側是用紅色和白色表現的三葉形花瓣，再外側是配了四個用黃色做邊的紅和淡綠的三葉紋。<br>
            圖41－5下方的斷片，是曾用作《西域》圖版LXII中展示的幡頭吊環。正面是三枚綾，反面則是平織，緯線的顔色像金色的柔和黃色。<br>
            圖案是交錯相配的藍色地上淡紅色和亮橙色的六瓣花的行列，其間加了帶花和莖的花飾，和面向淡紅色花的一對鳥。從鳥的胸部伸出另一花飾，鳥棲在從那花飾上吊下的菱形裝飾上，再其下是垂著蝴蝶結的飄帶裝飾。正如斯坦因記述的，鳥是“非常寫實”的，頭、胸部是斑點，尾巴是橙紅色，身體其他部分是用黃和白色來表現，眼睛和翅膀的線和底色一樣都用藍色（斯坦因記錄爲帶青色的深綠色）。此鳥極富變化的精妙表現，使人覺得與斯坦因收集的，如小片布拼成的《袈裟》（圖9）上所見的極小卻非常鮮亮的一對家鴨等織物圖樣中所見的鳥的若干圖案有密切關連。<br>
            41－6圖的斷片，正面爲四枚綾，反面是平織，其圖案設計與圖9《袈裟》後邊的夾纈染的圖案相似（參照同圖解說15）。紋樣恰好保留了一行大致完整的部分，大的花紋周圍，各自交叉排列著八個青和綠色的三瓣花。其上下行列的圖案幾乎未能保留下來，但從上行的殘部看，渦卷形的四方中配有相同的三瓣花的菱形紋樣。如斯坦因所述，使此圖案更具華麗形式的物品，見於正倉院傳下來的中國制銀器和染織品上。另外，敦煌唐代的天井畫紋樣上也有基本形式相同的各種圖案。再有，斯坦因發現的唐代絹中，也有許多件有極密切聯繫的作品（例如《絲綢之路》圖版43、44的，與大曆十三年（778年）的文書一同從381號墓出土的《變體寶相華紋錦》等）。<br>

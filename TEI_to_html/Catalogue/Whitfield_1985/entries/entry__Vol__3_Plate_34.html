            Late Tang or Five Dynasties, 9th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Banner painted in silver on red silk damask<br>
            Whole banner: L. 386.0 cm, W. 68.1 cm<br>
            Stein painting 217 (Ch. xxviii. 007)<br>
            See also Fig. 11<br>
            This larger than life-size Bodhisattva is too fragmentary for inclusion in Vols. 1 or 2, and is included here only for the interest of its damask ground. Figure 11 shows the whole banner, with a seated Buddha in the headpiece. The Bodhisattva stands beneath a garlanded canopy. Only part of the cartouche on the left remains, ending with the characters pusa, or Bodhisattva; this must have originally identified the figure. On the right is another cartouche, read by Waley (Catalogue, p. 188) as follows:<br>
            May the land be peaceful and its people prosperous;<br>
            May the rural shrines continually flourish.<br>
            May the whole house be clear and happy;<br>
            May the lives (of the inhabitants) be long extended.<br>
            At the top of the banner is a valance bordered with rosettes and pairs of half-rosettes, surmounted by the triangular headpiece (Fig. 11). The nimbus has a border of rather well-spaced cloud motifs. The general configuration is reminiscent of Tang ninth-century models (stein compared it to the “Indian” Bodhisattva; see Vol. 1, Pl. 51), but the large scale and indifferent execution of the characters may point to a date late in the ninth century or even in the tenth century. The whole banner, which is painted in silver and not a substitute, must have looked very splendid when new, quite suited to the lavish scale of the tenth-century caves at Dunhuang. The silver, possibly applied as leaf, is quite thickly preserved in parts; elsewhere only the underdrawing or sizing remains. The eyes are accented with fine ink outlines.<br>
            As for the textiles of the banner, the headpiece has a faded border that has lost its colour and design. The design, as still visible to Stein from the back, is described in Serindia, Vol.Ⅱ, p. 1037, and consisted of salmon pink floral spots on a bluish white ground. Part remains also of an indigo border of plain silk, which has helped to preserve the colour of the red damask of the triangular panel with the seated Buddha. This is of one piece with the main part of the banner, and consists of a whole width of silk damask, about 60 cm selvedge to selvedge. A reconstruction of the design is seen in Serindia, Pl. CXXII. The details in this plate show parts of the design where they can best be seen: the group of four birds flying towards a central quatrefoil rosette, and the flowers with clear lotus centres, on stems growing inward from the edges between each group of birds. Ground and pattern are woven in twills, running in the same direction. The repeats in the design occur approximately every 15 cm.<br>

            唐末·五代時期，9世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            綾地銀泥<br>
            高386.0釐米 寬68.1釐米<br>
            斯坦因繪畫217（Ch.xxviii.007）<br>
            參照Fig.11<br>
            比真身大的此菩薩像，作爲繪畫資料，收錄於第1卷乃或第2卷，則顯得損壞過於嚴重，因此作爲綾的資料，收錄於本卷中。包括幡頭的坐佛在內的整體幡，展示在Fig.11中。菩薩站立在被花環裝飾的華蓋下。左側的長方形題記框中，僅有末尾菩薩兩字，無疑當時在這裏沒有記入像名。右側也有一題記，Waley將此題記釋讀如下（參照《敦煌畫目錄》，188頁）。<br>
            願國安民泰社稷恒昌<br>
            闔它清吉壽命延長<br>
            “祈願國泰民安，社稷繁榮昌盛，家家清潔幸福，人人長壽□□□”<br>
            幡的上端為三角形(Fig. 11)，有花紋和相對的半花紋交叉排列的邊飾，其下繪著垂幕。頭光上排列著適當間隔的雲紋。其整體印象使人想起9世紀的作品（斯坦因與第1卷圖51的印度式菩薩做了比較），從尺寸的大小以及不見有個性的表現等方面看，可以判斷其年代爲9世紀末至10世紀左右。整個畫像都未使用代用品，全都用銀泥描繪，當時是非常華麗的，正與敦煌10世紀时規模宏大的作品吻合。銀可能使用的像箔那麽厚，現在都已基本脫落，只留下了底描線和礬水的痕迹。眼睛是用細墨線強調的。<br>
            至於此幡的織物，幡頭可看出顔色和紋樣完全消失了的山形絹邊。關於其圖案，斯坦因寫報告書時，似乎曾從內側看過，在《西域》（1037頁）中，有青白色地上分佈著淡紅色的小花的記載。也留下一部分深藍色平絹的邊布，其下邊曾是三角形幡頭部分的綾地上，仍殘留著發紅的顔色。此幡頭部分也是由和幡的主要部分連在一起的絹子作成，此幡使用的是兩端有織邊的幅寬約60釐米的絹。《西域》（參照圖版CXXII）中收錄了織紋設計的復原圖。本書中展示的是織紋顯得最清楚的兩處。紋樣的構成是四瓣花的周圍飛翔著四隻鳥，及從織邊到織邊橫向延伸的莖的上下，飾有帶蓮子的蓮花和葉子的圖案。質地、紋樣也都是同方綾，紋樣每隔約15釐米重復一次。<br>

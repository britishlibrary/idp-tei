            Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220)<br>
            From a watchtower on the Dunhuang border wall<br>
            Warp-patterned silk double cloth<br>
            Lower piece: 6.8×19.0 cm<br>
            MAS 820 (T. XXⅡ. c. 0010.a)<br>
            Both from the place of discovery and from the style of their design, these must be among the earliest of the textiles found by Stein. Before investigating the Mogao caves, or Qianfodong, Stein spent some weeks investigating the limes, or whole line of watchtowers, along the westernmost extension of the Great Wall. Each watchtower was identified by the letter T (for Tun-huang) and a Roman numeral. The two fragments here, chosen from a group of nine, all but one of which show the same pattern, are from watchtower number T. XXII. c, the tower at which Stein recovered a document that was the earliest of all those from the limes, dated to a year corresponding to 98 B.C. Stein investigated this tower on May 13, 1907, the last day before turning back to Dunhuang itself.<br>
            The material is a double cloth in plain weave, hence very tight and close. It is extremely worn on one side, and so the illustration shows what may have been the reverse, with the pattern in indigo on a faded gold, rather than the other way around. Stein described it best:<br>
            Among the very numerous fragments of fabrics [found at this watchtower] ... the most interesting piece ... is the patchwork ... made up of small strips of a figured silk in indigo and yellow-green. It contains figures of dragons, birds and phoenixes set in highly conventional scroll-work, and other ornamental designs. The general style and treatment are unmistakably Chinese, as may reasonably be expected in a decorated silk dating from Han times, when China still claimed the monopoly of producing textiles of that material. The extremely fine weaving attests the high technical level reached in this essentially Chinese manufacture. The piece claims importance as one of the oldest specimens of textile art undoubtedly Chinese, and the indications it furnishes as to style and technique have since received striking confirmation from the abundant finds of brocades, dating from Han times, which I discovered in 1914 at cemeteries of the Lou-lan area.<br>
            In view of the early date of the specimen and the certainty of its origin, it is all the more interesting to find in it certain elements of design, like the four birds grouped round what suggests a conventional tree, fore-shadowing motifs which we are apt to consider as characteristic of textile art in the Persia of Sassanian times and in the Near-Eastern regions influenced by it. (Serindia, Vol. I, p. 720)<br>
            Stein drew attention, in a footnote, to the “curious figured fabric” from Dunhuang, shown here in Pl. 37. The two fabrics are indeed very close in weaving technique, in general organization of the design with pairs of animals, and in details such as the hooked volutes at the centres and the hatched edges to the lozenges. Similar features such as rather large hooked volutes are found on another silk textile from Dunhuang, MAS 803. They are also found in other specimens from Xinjiang, which are referred to in the notes to Pl. 37.<br>

            後漢時期，25～220年<br>
            敦煌漢長城烽火臺遺址出土<br>
            雙層龍鳳紋經錦<br>
            下片6.8×19.0釐米<br>
            MAS820（T.XXII.C.0010.a）<br>
            從發現的地點以及紋樣的樣式看，此斷片在斯坦因收集的染織品中是時代最早的。斯坦因將考察敦煌前的幾周，花費在長城西端斷斷續續延伸的漢代烽火臺遺址的考察上。他在T字母（敦煌的首字母）上加羅馬數字來標示那些烽火臺遺址，本圖中的斷片，是從標注爲T. XXII.C的烽火臺獲得的九件斷片中的兩件。那九件，除了一件外，其餘都有相同的紋樣。並且，斯坦因在一連串烽火臺遺址上發現的全部遺物中，在此烽火臺發現了最早的，記有公元前98年紀年的。斯坦因考察此地是在1907年5月13日，是返回敦煌莫高窟的前夕。<br>
            此斷片是平地的經錦，織紋細密。圖版中展示的，褪色的金色底子上顯現深藍色紋樣的面，大概是反面，但相反的面破損嚴重。有關此斷片，斯坦因個人有很精闢的解說，引用如下。“（從此烽火臺發現的）衆多的紡織品碎片中，最有意義的是，……斷片拼接物，……由織出的深藍色和黃綠色紋樣的細長條錦構成。這些斷片，在傳統的渦卷和其它裝飾中，還組合有龍、鳥、鳳凰等紋樣。總體上看，其風格和技法勿庸置疑都是中國的，絲織物在漢代時期是中國獨有的製品。織法也極美，技術水準顯示出只有中國製品才能達到的高度。在以後的1914年，我從樓蘭古墓發現了大量漢代織錦片，對於此風格和技法，可以說是取得了極有衝突力的確鑿證據，此件織錦爲中國最早的織物之一，而得到了重視。针对年代古老和出土地點確鑿來說，此時我們往往認爲的具有薩珊王朝時期的波斯及其影響下的近東地區染織品的特點，如圖案化的樹類物周圍環繞四隻鳥的紋樣等，就非常有意义了。”（參照《西域》720頁）。<br>
            斯坦因在上述解說的腳註中，把本書圖37的斷片作爲敦煌出土的“值得注意的織物”列出。這兩件織物的紡織技法、相對動物組合圖案的構成方法，中心是鈎狀的渦卷形及邊上是絨毛狀的菱紋等紋樣的細部，都有類似之處。與此相似的較大的鈎狀渦卷圖案，在敦煌出土的其他斷片（MAS803）中也見到過。另外，在上圖的解說中列舉的新疆維吾爾自治區出土的斷片中，也見到同類的紋樣。<br>

            Tang dynasty, first half of the 7th century A.D.<br>
            From Astana<br>
            Painted wood<br>
            Left: L. 15.0 cm, W. 7.0 cm, H. 6.0 cm<br>
            Right: L. 14.4 cm, W. 7.0 cm, H. 5.6 cm<br>
            1928 10-22 94,95 (Ast. i. 1. 012, Ast. i. 3. 021)<br>
            These two ducks, among others found by Stein in early seventh century tombs at Astana (cf. Innermost Asia, Vol. Ⅱ, pp. 681, 707), are carved and painted with great economy of form, the underside boat-shaped as though the ducks are sitting on the water; another of similar size but with the body hollowed out as a small container has also been found at Gaochang (Xinjiang chutu wenwu, Pl. 76), and was no doubt intended to furnish the deceased with the kind of domestic animals that formed part of his household during his lifetime.<br>
            The two tombs from which these came were among those in the northeast corner of the Astana cemetery, and were small rectangular chambers with the entrance facing south-east and no enclosure above ground. Besides pottery, wooden goblets and bowls, numerous fragments of silk were found in them, and the faces of the dead were covered with a silk cover and silver eve-covers or “spectacles.” In the mouths of some of the deceased, including one of the two bodies in Ast. i. 3, there was a thin gold piece, struck only on the obverse, in imitation of a gold coin of Emperor Justinian I (A.D. 527-65). Imitations of Byzantine or other coins were used for this purpose since there was no Chinese gold coinage. Since other tombs in the group Ast. i contained funerary tablets dated A.D. 608, 632 and 646, the dating of the group as a whole is quite clear.<br>

            唐代，7世紀前半葉<br>
            阿斯塔那出土<br>
            長15.0釐米 寬7.0釐米 高6.0釐米<br>
            長14.4釐米 寬7.0釐米 高5.6釐米<br>
            1928 10－22 94，95（Ast.i.1.012,Ast.i.3.021）<br>
            這裏列舉的木製家鴨，是斯坦因從阿斯塔那7世紀初期的古墓（參照《亞洲腹地》681，707頁）發現的若干隻中的兩隻。使用毫無多餘的簡潔雕刻和彩色來表現，下部成舟形，看似漂浮在水面上。還有一件也是發現於阿斯塔那的高昌國時期的作品，與此尺寸相同，但它體內是掏空的（參照《新疆出土文物》圖版76）。這應是死者想把生前自家飼養的家畜類帶到墓裏供養的物品之一。<br>
            發現本圖家鴨的兩個墓，位於阿斯塔那古墓群的東北角，小的矩形墓室，朝東南方向的門開著，沒有塋圈。據說從這些墓室裏，除發現了木製酒杯和缽等外，還發現大量絹料，死者的臉部用絹覆蓋著，眼睛上帶著銀的眼罩。另外，在包括阿斯塔那第i區3號墓兩身中的一身在內的數軀骸骨中，嘴裏均塞著金的薄片。這是君士坦丁一世（527～565年）時期金幣的仿造品，在中國出現金幣以前，拜占廷其他仿造幣，被用作死者的口中的含物。從阿斯塔那第i區的其他墓中，出土了有608年、632年、646年紀年的墓誌，此整個墓區的年代大致是在此前後。<br>

            This seated figure, entirely flat at the back, was made in a mould as an appliqué piece. It was one of the Buddha figures in the nimbus of a colossal standing figure of the Buddha, of which only the lower legs and drapery were still extant when Stein examined and photographed the site (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XIVb). The oval head, which has lost the facial features, echoes the treatment seen in the large head (Pl. 63). The regular drapery folds are for the most part simple incised lines, hugging the form beneath and following the general conventions of Gandharan sculpture. Due to early consolidation work, the surface of the figure has acquired a shine which differs from the matt appearance of the original red clay wash.<br>

            此佛坐像的背面完全是平的，是用模子製作的化佛。化佛是安裝在巨大佛立像的頭光上的，當斯坦因考查此遺迹進行拍照時，那巨像的腳尖和衣紋還殘留著（參照《古代和田》圖版XIV.b）。頭部爲橢圓形，面部已經破損，其色彩大概與圖63的佛頭相同。另外，衣紋線基本是用簡單而有規則的刻線表現，衣服下的線條很有肉感，大概融合了犍陀羅雕刻的流派。由於早期的固化作用，像的表面出現一層光澤，這與紅粘土製品表面沒有光澤是不同的。<br>

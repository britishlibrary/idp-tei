            This, like the painted banners shown in Vol. 1, Pl. 28, is preserved complete, from the suspension loop at the top to the painted weighting board at the bottom. The construction is identical to the painted banners, except that here two additional bamboo splints are inserted at the joins between the coloured panels. Clearly the sequence of colours-blue, white and red (repeated in the companion banner shown in the next plate)-must have had its significance, but I am not able to explain this. The headpiece (Pl. 10-2) is a confection of a variety of handsome fabrics. One border is, as Stein described it, “of fine plain plum-coloured silk, calendered on [the] outside,” the other is a green damask with a lozenge pattern. The two large pieces in the centre, one of them showing an eagle with wings outspread, are both weft-faced silks. The streamer hanging at the left includes a piece of glazed silk. The three tail streamers are joined at the top and bottom, having been cut from a single piece of silk, the cut edges rolled and sewn to prevent fraying. The side streamers are attached so as to partly cover the three main panels when the banner is viewed from the front. This effect is lost when viewed from the back, but otherwise the appearance is virtually the same, the weighting board being painted on both sides: the weft-faced silk in the headpiece, the design of which can only be properly seen from the one side, indicates the front.<br>

            此幡與第1卷圖28的絹繪幡相同，從上端的吊環到幡畫下端的鎮板，所有的部位都完整地保留下來。構造方面，本圖幡的彩絹的連接處插了竹籖，除了其數量比絹繪的幡多出兩根這一點不同外，其他方面完全一樣。幡身青、白、紅色的順序（也在與此幡是一對的下圖幡中重復著），無疑有某種意義，但我無法解釋。幡頭（圖10－2）是用美麗的織物拼接而成。正斯坦因所說，一端的邊是“有光澤的紫色精美平絹”，另一端是加了菱形織紋的綠色綾。中央部分是兩塊布料拼合的，其中一塊上可見展翅的鷹，兩塊都是緯錦。側面幡尾中的左側也有一部分使用了有光澤的絹。幡腳是在一塊絹上做出切口，使之成爲三根，上下端仍連接在一起，爲了不使切口脫線，鎖了邊。兩側的幡尾，從幡的正面看，略微遮擋幡身。這種效果從背面看不出，而其他特點從背面看是一樣的。鎮板的兩面上都有彩繪，但幡頭緯錦上的圖案，只能從一側看到，它是幡正面的標誌。<br>

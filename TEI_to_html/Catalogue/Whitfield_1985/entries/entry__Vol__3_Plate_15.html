            Tang dynasty, 8th – 9th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Silk printed in jiaxie technique<br>
            H.68.6 cm, W. 52.5 cm<br>
            MAS 885 (Ch. 00357)<br>
            This piece of silk comes from an even larger silk banner than the one shown in Pl. 12. It was originally attached to a second panel of plain red silk of the same dimensions, sewn above it. If there were originally four panels, the body of the banner, with the headpiece, would have been some 3.5 m high, and the tail streamers could easily have doubled this. Thus it would have been similar in size to the red damask banner of a standing Bodhisattva (Fig. H; Pls. 34-1, 34-2), or even longer.<br>
            The full width of the fabric is seen, with a selvedge down each side. For printing, the silk was folded down the centre line, and then in the middle, to produce pairs of confronting horses, repeated upside down below the middle line. The boards used to compress the fabric must have about 70 cm high and 27 cm wide. The design, as discussed by Stein (Serindia, vol.Ⅱ, pp. 910-11) is basically Sasanian, but reveals Chinese workmanship by “the spirited life-like rendering of the ponies’ figures and the free trotting movement with which they are represented.... In the lower pair of ponies, with their short thick-set bodies, heavy heads, and short ears, the type peculiar to the Mongol horse, as I know it, is quite unmistakable. The pair above, with their spotted coats and heavy bellies, are meant evidently for a different type, which, however, owing to the missing heads, cannot be determined.”<br>
            Besides these knowledgeable observations on the horses, Stein also comments on the thinness of the silk and consequent “running” of the colours. This feature can be well understood in the context of the printing technique, which involved sandwiching at least four, and possibly more, layers of silk between boards.<br>

            唐代，8～9世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            夾纈印染絹<br>
            高68.6釐米 寬52.5釐米<br>
            MAS885（Ch.00357）<br>
            此斷片可能比圖12中所示的幡大很多。原來此斷片的上方綴縫著大小大致相同的紅色絹。如果假定其是四片的幡，那麽幡頭和幡身就達3.5米左右，幡腳應足以超過其兩倍。因此，整體的尺寸與繪著觀音菩薩像的赤色綾幡（參照Fig 11，圖34-1、圖34-2）大致相同，只是前者稍長。<br>
            此斷片的兩側有織邊，這正好說明是滿幅絹。印紋樣時，先把絹縱向對折，然後從中央馬的下方再次橫向對折。因而，中央部位出現了面對面、形狀相同的小馬，在下方可見到與它們反向的，倒著的小馬腿。此夾纈染用的板，大概高有70釐米，寬有27釐米左右。其風格上正如斯坦因所講述的（參照《西域》910頁），基本上是薩珊朝的，但加了中國式的手法。關於此紋樣，斯坦因說“小馬的姿態被表現的生動活潑，令人有輕快的動感……下方的一對小馬，無疑抓住了我都非常瞭解的蒙古馬的特徵，小而肥的身體、大頭、短耳等。上方的一對，從身體上有斑文，看似很重的腹部看，顯然和下方的一對不同，但缺頭部，無法判別。”<br>
            斯坦因除對馬有豐富觀察之外，還對絹的薄厚、色彩的深淺也有記述。關於那些特徵，如果考慮此斷片一次至少有四塊，或者可能是更多的絹，夾在板子間採用夾纈技法染的，那麽可以說是極其自然的事。<br>

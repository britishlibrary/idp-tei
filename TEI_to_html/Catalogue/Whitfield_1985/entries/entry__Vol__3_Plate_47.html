            From Dunhuang<br>
            Moulded and painted clay plaque<br>
            H. 28.4 cm, W. 17.7 cm<br>
            1928 10-22 26 (Ch. 0031)<br>
            Revisiting the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas in April 1914, during his third expedition, Stein was still able to acquire antiquities from the priest Wang, despite the fact that Paul Pelliot and others had been there in the meantime and that six cartloads of manuscripts had been officially removed to Beijing. Of the new acquisitions, 570 were manuscripts, placed by Wang inside two large boxes in his storeroom and so not taken with the remainder of the contents of Cave 17 to Beijing. After negotiating their sale, Wang presented Stein with a small collection of stucco plaques, which Wang said he had found loose in the sand, but which Stein felt came from a frieze in one of the caves near the centre of the site.<br>
            This small moulded plaque, painted and quite richly gilt, was one of these late acquisitions. Others are known, for example in the Pelliot collection, and these are so close as to have probably come from the same location. The monk, appropriately for a representation which may have been placed outside, wears his robe in the covering mode, serving as a hood around the face, and closely tucked around the neck. The hands and feet are quite hidden. The robe has gilded edges, and is further ornamented with floral motifs, one on top of the head and the others scattered over the robe. From the simplified representation and particularly the proportions of the large head and upper body in contrast to the rather diminutive shape presented by the hidden knees, one imagines that this is a work of the late Tang or even later.<br>

            唐代，9～10世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            彩色塗金的模壓<br>
            高28.4釐米 寬17.7釐米<br>
            1928 10－22 26（Ch.031）<br>
            斯坦因再訪敦煌，是在第三次探險時的1914年4月，儘管在他上次訪問後伯希和等其他人也曾探訪這裏，裝了六輛貨車的文書類經卷，通過官方之手，也已運至北京，但此次他還是從王道士手中得到了很多物品。新收集品中有570件是文書，是藏經洞收藏的物品運至北京後的剩餘部分，王道士裝了兩大箱藏起來的。這次交易結束後，王道士贈送給斯坦因幾個半身塑像。據王道士說，那些是散亂在沙漠中被他發現的，而斯坦因認爲，是構成近於遺迹中央石窟的一個柱子中楣的塑像。<br>
            此彩色塗金的模壓浮雕像，如上所述，是後來增添的收集品中的一件。其他還有如伯希和的收集品等，是從同一場所攜來的。此僧像的樣子，好像是在戶外，用衣服緊緊裹住身體，用頭巾似的東西圍住頭，並下垂遮住衣襟，手腳完全被遮蓋。衣服用金彩做邊，花紋樣的裝飾，除頭上有一個外，還散落在衣服上。從簡略化的表現，頭和上半身較大，對比之下，衣服遮掩的膝蓋又顯得很小等方面看，可考慮這是晚唐或者更晚時期製作的。<br>

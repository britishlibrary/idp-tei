            Silk damask<br>

            This piece has been folded diagonally, probably to make it into the triangular headpiece of a banner; the edges have also been fringed. Where the edges were once covered by other parts of the headpiece, the original colour, a beautiful salmon pink, can still be seen, but elsewhere it has faded to a pale yellow. The design, which is in 3/1 twill on a ground of tightly woven 2/1 twill, is of a large peacock displaying and holding in its beak a knot, part of an interlacing band. Presumably this pattern was reversed so that two birds faced each other with the knot between. A design of a similar interlacing band on a cream silk damask is illustrated in Serindia, Pl. CXVII.<br>

            此織物發現時是對角折疊的，可能是用於幡頭的三角形部分。四邊的線已脫落成穗狀。周邊曾被其他布料遮蓋過的部分，仍保留了當初美麗的淡紅色彩，其餘部分都已褪色，呈現出淡黃色。地的紋樣顯現出綾組織，可辨出巨大孔雀嘴裏銜著飄帶飾物結的圖案。此圖案的形狀可能是以飄帶爲中心，兩側是相向的兩隻孔雀。其設計的復原圖被收錄在《西域》的圖版CXVIII中。<br>

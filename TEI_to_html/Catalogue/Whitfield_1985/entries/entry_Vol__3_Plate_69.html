            From Dandan-oilik<br>
            Painted wood<br>
            H. 38.5 cm, W. 18.0 cm<br>
            British Museum,1907 11-11 70 (D. VII. 5)<br>
            The theme of the aristocratic rider, holding a bowl or wine cup into which a bird appears to be diving, is a frequent one near Khotan, while the mounts themselves, here a dappled horse and a camel, suggest comparisons with, among others, the scroll with sketches of a tribute horse and camel (Vol. 2, Pl. 56) and indeed the large model of a horse from a grave at Astana (Pl. 91). A similar horse and rider, originally one of a series of riders on horses and camels, appears in the wall painting of the Sudhana jataka which Stein photographed in Shrine II at Dandan-oilik but was unable to remove, and which has always been counted as one of the masterpieces of Khotanese painting (see Andrews, 1948, Pl. XXXII).<br>
            It has been suggested by Joanna Williams that the meaning of this theme may be provided by its association with Vaisravana on a painted wooden panel acquired from Khotan by Sir Clarmont Skrine and now in the British Museum (1925 6-19 25): in it the rider advances towards a standing figure of the Guardian King, and is accompanied by two black birds. Vaisravana had a special position as guardian of Khotan (cf. Vol. 2,Pl. 50), and the riders with birds may represent Khotan’s Turkish neighbours, following a legend in which one of Vaisravana’s yaksa attendants shot down Pekar, the tutelary hero of the Uighur Turks, when he had assumed the form of a bird of prey (Williams, 1973, pp. 151-52). In this case the figures in this panel would represent tributaries to Khotan.<br>
            The reverse of this plaque is unpainted and has the remains of several wooden pegs by which it could be hung of fastened to the wall of the shrine.<br>

            6世紀<br>
            丹丹烏里克出土<br>
            木板畫<br>
            高38.5釐米,寬18.0釐米<br>
            英國博物館，1907 11－11 70（D.VII.5）<br>
            描绘貴族騎士手持碗或酒杯，有鳥飛下的題材，常見於和田附近地區。如果單講騎士乘用有斑點的馬或駱駝，則使想起墨畫淡彩的《馬·駱駝進貢圖》（參照第二卷圖56）及阿斯塔那古墓出土的大型馬俑（參照圖91）等作品。相似的馬和騎士還可在描绘“龍鼓池傳說”的和田壁畫中见到，斯坦因曾在丹丹烏里克第II寺址中，對其壁畫進行过拍攝，但没有采用。此壁畫常被作爲和田壁畫的代表作之一而被提起（參照Andrews《中亞壁畫》,1948,圖版XXXII）。<br>
            有關這一主題的含義，據Joanna Williams所述，與Clarmont Skrine收集于和田，現藏于大英博物館的木板畫（1925 6－19 35）上所見的毘沙門天像有關。那幅木板畫中，繪有騎馬人物行向天王立像，還配有兩隻黑色的鳥。毘沙門天作爲于闐的保護神佔有特殊地位（參照第2卷圖50的解說），伴隨鳥的騎馬人物表現的是于闐鄰國的突厥人。據傳說，毘沙門天的侍者，討伐裝扮成餌食鳥的突厥回鶻族的守護神白哈爾（Pekar）（參照上述Williams論文，131～152頁）。如果是這樣，此木板畫則描繪的是于闐屬國的人物。<br>
            其背面沒有繪畫，殘存數枚木釘，或為固定在寺院牆上之用。<br>

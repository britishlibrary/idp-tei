            6th- 7th century A.D.<br>
            From Ming-oi<br>
            Moulded clay tile<br>
            H. 22.5 cm, W. 23.6 cm<br>
            MAS 1108 (Mi. xxiii. 1)<br>
            This fine tile shows a complete design, which is similar to that of the fragment shown in the preceding plate. The back of the tile is roughly smoothed, but there are signs of its having been attached to the wall with a thin pad of clay. Stein thought that the tile had been separately fired before use, as well as undergoing an accidental firing when the site was destroyed.<br>
            The subject is a splendid Bodhisattva head, set in a roundel with a large pearl border. The hair is bound with a twisted fillet which has one pearled strand; above this the central feature is a five-petalled lotus with a pearl border. The whole tile was moulded in one piece, but some details such as the small side-locks and the ear ornaments (smaller pearled roundels) were separately moulded and applied. The spandrels are filled with scrolling motifs.<br>
            The style of the face and hair, like that of many of the stucco figures from Ming-oi and that of the moulds found by Oldenburg and Le Coq, is not far removed from the art of Gandhara. The threefold use of the pearl border (in the ear ornaments, the lotus headpiece, and around the whole head) is a valuable guide to the date. By the Sui dynasty, in the late sixth century, usage of pearl borders had reached Dunhuang and was well established, in both borders and garment patterns (cf. Cave 420; Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, Vol. 2, Pl. 62). Thus, there can be little doubt that the mould used for this tile was made in the sixth century, and the tile itself is probably not much later in date.<br>

            6～7世紀<br>
            焉耆（明屋）出土<br>
            模製泥磚<br>
            高22.5釐米 寬23.6釐米<br>
            MAS1108(Mi.xxiii.1)<br>
            此精致的磚，完全保留著和前圖中展示的斷片基本相同的設計。背面是粗糙的平板，可看到把它安裝在牆壁上時所用的粘土痕迹。斯坦因認爲，此磚不僅遭受过遺迹被破壞時的意外火災，還在使用前燒煉過。<br>
            用大聯珠紋圈起來的圓盤中央配有華麗的菩薩頭部，其頭髮用有聯珠紋的帶子紮起。另外，上面頭飾中央的五瓣蓮華飾的周圍，也圈著聯珠紋。整個磚是用一個模子作的，而兩側小的穗狀毛髮和耳飾（用聯珠紋圈起的小圓盤）等，是單獨製作後安裝上的。三角拱肩被旋渦形的裝飾填充。<br>
            臉和頭髮的樣子，與奧登堡和勒柯克發現的模子以及從明屋帶回的大多泥像相同，與犍陀羅美術無太大差距。使用三層聯珠紋（耳飾、頭飾、圍頭部整體的圓形）這一點，是斷定年代的重要線索。聯珠紋是隋代以前，直到6世紀末，在敦煌流傳，定格在邊飾和衣紋的花飾這兩項上（參照420窟，《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第2卷圖62）。因此，首先認爲此磚的模子無疑是6世紀時製作的，另外，磚本身的年代也不會太晚。<br>

            The flying celestial figure was found to the east, and the two standing figures of the Buddha in the centre of the area of the shrine Kha. i at Khadalik, excavated by Stein in September 1906, in the early months of his second expedition. This shrine was originally very extensive, with about 900 feet (270 m) of wall, nearly all of which, Stein concluded, had been robbed of its wooden members not long after the abandonment of the site at the close of the eighth century A.D. One short section of wall, still left with its wall paintings intact, is seen in Vol. 1, expedition photograph: it shows stencilled Buddha figures wearing robes of red, dark brown, white or cream in regular alternation, similar to those found in the Khotan area.<br>
            Kha. i was one of the two main shrines at the site and must have contained many stucco statues of life-size or larger. Such small appliqué figures as those shown here formed part of the decoration within the vesicas surrounding these statues. Some idea of their disposition can be seen from the vesica from Dandan-oilik partially preserved with its border (Pl. 73). As at Dandan-oilik, a site which Stein had explored on his first expedition and with which he was already familiar when he reached Khadalik, these small figures, and indeed the ornamental borders of the vesicas also, were produced by moulds, which continued in use over a long period, being used for repairs or to make replacement figures as needed.<br>
            Other finds from the Khadalik shrines included specimens of wood carving, wooden votive panels with paintings (very similar to those found at Dandan-oilik) and hundreds of manuscripts chiefly in Brahmi script but including fragments of two or three records in Tibetan, evidence of the presence of the Tibetans before the site was abandoned in the eighth century.<br>

            此三件均是斯坦因第二次探險初期的1906年9月發掘出的。飛天在Kha（喀達裏克）i號寺址的東部，兩身佛立像在同一寺址的中央位置發現的。斯坦因認爲，此寺址當初有邊長約270米的外牆圍著，是相當大的，到8世紀末時被遺棄，其後不久，幾乎所有的木材部分都被搶走。有可見內牆的部分免遭破壞的牆面的照片，已刊登在《西域》（參照第1卷插圖41；本書第1卷的“記錄照片”）中。此與和田地區發現的千佛相同，使用模子然後繪的小佛，可看出把各種衣服的顔色，按照紅色、褐色、白或黃色的規律斜著排列的意向。<br>
            喀達裏克i號寺址，是屬於此遺迹兩個主要寺院中的一個，似乎曾有過很多等身大或更大的塑像。像圖版中展示的此種小浮雕像，是粘貼在那些大型塑像的背光上作爲裝飾的。從丹丹烏裏克發現，周邊的一部分仍殘留的背光斷片（圖73）上，可看出其裝配的例子。這些小裝飾像以及那些粘貼裝飾的背光的周邊部分等，均使用模子製作。那些模子通過修復和補充，能延續使用很長時間。考察喀達裏克時，斯坦因根據第一次探險時丹丹烏裏克的發掘經驗，有關那些方面也很有心得。<br>
            從喀達裏克寺院遺址發現的其他出土品中，有與在丹丹烏裏克發現的完全相似的木雕品以及板繪、衆多文書類等。文書類幾乎都用婆羅謎文字書寫的，也有兩三件用吐蕃文寫的斷片，可見此遺址在8世紀被遺棄之前，也曾住過吐蕃人。<br>

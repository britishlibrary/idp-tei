            These heads, three from the ruined cella, xi, and the fourth from the chamber behind, clearly show the use of moulding and modelling techniques. The heads in Pls. 104 and 105 are from the same mould: after moulding, deeply incised lines gave individual character to the turban of hair, and pieces of clay applied to the cheeks and chin of the upper head gave the face a much older appearance than the other. Further variation was created simply by slight changes in the angle of the head and in the hair line at the temples. Figure 132 shows another head from the same mould.<br>
            Plate 106 shows the head of a Brahman, with a quiet look of frowning concentration. The individual locks of the beard and moustache were separately moulded and then applied, and in this case the headdress as well appears to be moulded. For an idea of the appearance of such a figure when complete, we can turn to Le Coq’s finds of clay figures in the caves at the same site, where no fire had precipitated their ruin (Along the Ancient Silk Routes, Nos. 75 76). In these seated figures, a scarf, like those seen in Pls. 96-97, frames and shields the whole upper body. With their arms they make sweeping gestures, and it is clear that they are engaged in discussion.<br>
            The head in Pl. 107 is that of a young man grieving at the parinirvana of the Buddha, which was represented in the chamber behind the cella of the shrine. The effect of grief is heightened by the open mouth, the half-closed eyes, and additional lines in the forehead and around the mouth. Some of these effects were undoubtedly contrived after the moulding of the basic face.<br>
            Although the placement of such individual pieces is no longer known, some idea of the scale of the representation and the layout of the shrine can be gained from photographs. In a view through the side passage into the rear chamber of this shrine, reproduced by Oldenburg (Oldenburg, 1914, Pl. Ⅲ), the end of the reclining image of the Buddha is just visible. A photograph of the rear wall of the chamber (ibid., Pl. Ⅳ) shows how the clay figures were closely packed, and how the main focus of the group was concentrated at the point where the passage benefitted from some light from the side passage.<br>

            這裏展示的四個頭像，三個是xi内殿發現的，第四件是從其背後的小室發現的，每件都可清楚看出使用模子和修飾的技術。圖104、105是用同一模子製成，成型後，用深的刻線在頭巾狀的髮型上做出各自的特點，並在一個的臉頰和顎上施若干粘土，做出比另一個年長的臉部。臉頰和鬢角部分的髮際線也略有變化。Fig.132也是用模子做成的。<br>
            圖106是婆羅門的頭像，有皺起眉頭集中精神的寧靜表情。顎鬚和口髭是用模子做出一個個的穗狀再貼上的，這種方法也用於頭飾。有關這些像的完整形態，可參考勒柯克從未受火災的同一遺迹的石窟發現的幾個塑像（參照Along the Ancient Silk Routes，圖75、76）。關於圍起那些坐像上半身的像盾一樣的天衣，可以參考前面的圖96、97。他們打著手勢，顯然象是在交談。<br>
            圖107的頭像位於xi内殿後方xii室涅槃像的旁邊，是一個因釋迦入滅而悲哀的年輕男子。通過張開的嘴、半睜的眼、額和嘴上添加的橫皺紋等，渲染了悲哀的表情。當然這種表情是在基本形狀做成之後添加上的。<br>
            現在已無法知道每個像的具體位置，但從照片上大致能估計出整體的規模和寺內的設計。如奧登堡著書中所展示的，從此佛寺側廊向後方房屋眺望的照片（Oldenburg，1914，圖版III），那裏可以稍微看到佛臥像的一角。另外，在同書拍攝房屋後壁的（上揭書，圖版IV）中，可看出密密麻麻的塑像群的中心，凝聚在側廊光線的聚焦點上。<br>

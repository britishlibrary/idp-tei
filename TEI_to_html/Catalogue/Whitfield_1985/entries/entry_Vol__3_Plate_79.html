            Plate 79<br>

            Pottery<br>

            The small masks, both grotesque and human, seen in the previous plates were generally intended as applied ornaments for large vessels. Sometimes a fragment of the vessel wall has remained attached to the mask, but whole vessels are extremely rare, scarce enough for the Skrine Collection in the British Museum to contain one fake: a modern vase of lightweight clay with genuine but mismatched ancient handles in animal form.<br>
            The body of the vessel shown in this plate is wheel-made, dense and smooth on the plain surfaces. It was richly ornamented with incised, punched and appliqué decoration. The band of moulded oval rosettes around the widest part, the two human heads, and the pairs of swags in each of the panels on the shoulder are all part of this appliqué decoration. So too would have been the handles, in the form of animals, but these have broken off, and have, along with the neck, been ground down in antiquity so that the vessel might continue to be of some use.<br>
            Numerous examples of such handles, some of them griffin-like with a beaked head, others vaguely leonine or equine in character, and often winged, have been found at Yotkan and are in the major collections. Examples from the Stein Collection are shown in Figs. 106 and 107. One fragment in the British Museum (1902 12-20 361) shows exactly how such animal handles fitted onto the vessel, which was decorated in very similar fashion to the almost complete vase shown here. The animal stands on its hind legs (the two legs merge into one with an incised sketching in of the tail) above the mask on the shoulder; the front legs, also merged into one, are joined to the neck just beneath the flaring rim. The rim itself is flat, and the animal surmounted it so that it faced its opposite across the mouth of the vessel.<br>
            This vase, like al of the Yotkan terracottas, is unglazed, one of the factors arguing for a comparatively early date. The question of date for these finds has been extensively discussed by D’yakonova and Sorokin (1960) and summarized by Gropp (1974, pp. 297-98).<br>

            圖77、78的獸面或人面，原是粘在大的壺上的裝飾。有很多粘著這些裝飾的壺的斷片，但原封不動地完整保留下來的卻極少。大英博物館的Skrine收集品中，有一件經過大量修補而復原的。那是在重新製作的分量較輕的粘土制的壺體上，粘貼了收集來的真正古代的動物形把手，感覺略微有點不相稱。<br>
            本圖展示的壺體，是通過鏇盤成形的，器表細密光滑。上面有刻紋、穿孔、粘貼等華麗的裝飾，粘貼裝飾有壺體最突出部分的帶狀上用模子製作的卵形花紋，有圍繞其上肩部分的葉狀紋，還有兩個人面等。此壺也曾有動物形狀的把手，可能是因已損壞，沿著壺頸把上部砍掉了，之後作爲其它容器仍繼續使用過。<br>
            從約特幹發現的物品中，像這種把手在各地方的收集品中都很多，大多是有嘴的飛獅（有翼的獅子）形狀。除外，還有無法辨別是獅子還是馬的形狀，無論哪一種大多都是有翼的。斯坦因收集的三種收錄在Figs.106、107中。在大英博物館中亞美術的搜集中，還有其他斷片，可清楚看到這種動物形把手被安裝在壺上的方式（Hoernle ，PI.VIII.fig.8:1902 12-20 361）。其斷片的裝飾形式，與本圖中展示的大致完整形狀的壺極相似，動物以後肢（合併在一起，尾巴用刻紋表現）立於壺肩部的人面之上。前肢也一樣合爲一條，安裝在邊口正下方的壺頸部分。壺的邊口平整，兩隻動物隔壺口相對安裝。<br>
            與約特幹所有陶器一樣，此壺也是素陶，沒有加釉子這一點，是推測它們爲較早製品的根據之一。有關這些發掘品的年代問題，D’yakonova 和Sorokin做過概括性的論述（1960），Gropp做過歸納（1974，p.297-298）。<br>

            Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Painted silk and kesi tapestry<br>
            H.22.5 cm, W. 22.5 cm<br>
            MAS 905 (Ch. 0058)<br>
            This must have come from an extremely rich and sumptuous banner, as the borders are not assembled from fragments of plain silk, but are of kesi (kossu). The interior triangular piece of plain silk is painted with a large central flower and three other flowers in the corners, and the background between the flowers and foliage is filled in with blue. Only a fragment remains of the top of the banner, mainly consisting of a painted valance in stripes of orange and red, with narrower lines between. A tiny fragment of the actual painting shows a chocolate brown edge and yellow cartouche, rather similar to that seen in a banner with scenes of the life of the Buddha (Vol. 1, Pl. 30) and its companion in New Delhi (Ch. lv. 0010). The painted valance is also similar to that seen in another banner (Vol. 1, Pl. 38), which, like the former, has scenes from the life of the Buddha.<br>
            The kesi borders are the full width (2.7 cm) as originally woven with alternating full spots in the centre of the strip and pairs of half-spots along the edges. They have approximately 60 Z- ply warp threads. At the centre of each of the full spots is a small bird, perhaps a duckling, in a contrasting colour, brown or white or blue, with beak and feet in another colour again. A similar headpiece is attached to the banner of a Bodhisattva in Indian style (Ch. lv.0034; Serindia, Pls. LXXX and CVI) using the same tapestry-woven strip. A strip of paper covered with gold leaf is woven in as an elongated spot in each of the green petals, and the four buds (striped in brown, blue and white) are also edged with gold-leafed paper strips.<br>
            The uniquely Chinese technique of kesi (kossu) tapestry must have furnished the most precious of the fabrics found at Dunhuang. As seen in Pl. 6, it was used sparingly in very narrow strips to adorn the central panel of sutra wrappers, or as here to make up the headpieces of a matching set of banners of the highest quality.<br>

            唐代，8世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            彩畫·緙絲（錦）<br>
            高22.5釐米 幅寬22.5釐米<br>
            MAS905（Ch.0058）<br>
            從此幡頭的絹邊不是綴集了平絹斷片，而是使用了緙絲（錦）這一點看，它也是一件極盡奢華的幡的一部分。中心部位的三角形平絹上，繪著中央一朵大花，三角處各有一朵小花的畫，地用青色填滿。幡身的上端也殘留下來，在紅和橙色的縞上都加了細線繪的垂幕。其下仍殘留著一點點繪畫邊緣上的深褐色框和黃色題記框，其結構與第1卷圖30的《佛傳圖幡》以及和它成對的新德里國立博物館的幡（Ch.lv.0010）非常相似。垂幕的繪畫也和第1卷圖38等其他佛傳圖幡相似，這一點也可證明，此幡頭是繪有佛傳圖幡的一部分。<br>
            錦原是在此使用的幅面（2.7釐米）上，交叉織出中心部位的一個單位的紋樣和從兩旁派生出的一對半花紋。中心的紋樣帶中，似家鴨的小鳥配合背景的變化，以對照性的茶、白、青等色出現，在嘴和腳上還加了其他顔色。同樣有織錦邊的幡頭，還可見於印度式菩薩像的幡（參照Ch.lv.0034.《西域》圖版LXXX以及CVI）中。綠色的花瓣形狀中用金絲（用金箔卷的細紙）織出的細長線，四個花蕾（茶青、白色的縞）也有金絲的邊。<br>
            錦仅在中國獨自得到發展，在敦煌的各種出土物中，也是用在最高貴的物品上。正如圖8中所見的，作裝飾經帙中心部位的細帶子，或者像本圖一樣，僅少量的配在最高級的幡畫上的幡頭作絹邊。<br>

            5th century A.D.(?)<br>
            From Khora<br>
            Wood, with traces of pigment<br>
            H. 16.3 cm, W. 5.2 cm<br>
            MAS 981 (Khora. I. ii. 001)<br>
            This beautiful piece found in a small cella at Khora in the Karashahr Valley is very similar in size and style to the wooden Buddha found farther west near the large stupa at Tumshuk by Le Coq. Now in the Museum für Indische Kunst, Berlin, it was recently exhibited in New York (Le Coq, 1922, Vol. I, Pl.42; Along the Ancient Silk Routes, No. 47). Unlike the Stein Buddha, the Berlin figure has lost both its mandorla and nimbus, and also the base or throne. The figure of the Berlin Buddha is, however, somewhat larger, and its proportions are more satisfying. The carving of the Stein Buddha is less finished, showing many of the marks of the chisel, especially on the arms and torso. The latter is slender and tapering but bulges abruptly at the waist; the knees are pressed down parallel to the base, and since they do not extend beyond the base, help emphasize the spare and vertical torso. The arms are kept well separate and are sharply angled forward and inwards at the elbow. All of these features contrast with the gentler rhythms and smoother handling of plastic form in the Berlin Buddha.<br>
            The robe in each case is in the covering mode; on the Stein piece collar is indicated by a raised area running from shoulder to shoulder and dipping in the centre of the chest. In the Berlin figure the folds of the collar take the form of incised lines, gently twisting as the robe dips and widening slightly on the shoulder. In both, the robe drops symmetrically in folds from the wrists, forming a central panel with curved lower edge beneath the hands. Again, the Berlin figure is more finished, and its smooth robe, almost transparent except at the edges of the sleeves and collar, has been compared with Gupta sculptures from Sarnath.<br>
            The head of each figure is inclined forward, with high domed hair (particularly in the Stein piece), crowned by a very distinct usnisa, sharply angled in towards its base. The earlobes are particularly large, and in the Stein Buddha angled outwards until they reach the shoulders instead of falling straight.<br>
            At Dunhuang in the early caves, particularly Cave 259 of the Northern Wei (cf. Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, Vol. 1, Pl. 25), the same gentle type of meditating Buddha is found but in proportion and treatment closer to the Berlin figure than to the one shown here. Both pieces were once entirely covered with polychrome painting, which would have smoothed out some of the traces of the chisel; the other differences observable in the Stein figure may indicate a slightly earlier date, or a slightly less capable artist.<br>

            5世紀？<br>
            霍拉出土<br>
            木雕彩色<br>
            高16.3釐米 寬5.2釐米<br>
            MAS981（Khora.I.ii.001）<br>
            此精美雕刻是從位於焉耆谷的霍拉的内殿發現的，無論是尺寸還是風格上，它與勒柯克從西邊遙遠的圖木舒克遺迹的大佛塔附近發現的木雕佛像極其相似，現在那像已成爲柏林印度美術館的收藏品，最近在紐約展覽（參照“Le Coq” 1922,I,圖42，Along the Ancient Silk Routes, No. 47）。柏林收藏的坐像與斯坦因收藏品中的坐像不一樣，頭光和身光已殘缺，台座和基壇也沒有了。然而，柏林的佛坐像的高要大幾分，比例更加和諧。斯坦因收集品中的像雕刻尚未完工，手臂、身體等處都留著鑿刻痕迹。身體苗條，越往下越細，而腹部卻鼓起。膝蓋爲符合基壇而表現窄小，基本沒有越出基壇外，使細而直立的身體很顯眼。兩臂與軀體隔開斜著垂下，肘部做出的角度彎向前方內側。這種表現均與柏林像的沈穩格調和感覺平滑流暢的處理形成對比。<br>
            雙方的衣服都是通肩的，斯坦因收集品中的像上，搭在兩肩間的衣領隆起，中央部分在胸前降低。而柏林的像，衣領上加了刻線，表現的是寬鬆地披在肩上的樣子。兩者的衣袖都從左右手腕對稱地垂下，兩手之下的部分，是下邊成圓形的板狀。前面曾講過，柏林像基本完成，流暢的衣紋除了在袖口和領子邊，均表現得極薄，使人想起Sarnath笈多時期的雕刻。<br>
            兩像的頭部都向前傾，髮型呈高圓頂狀（尤其是斯坦因收集品更明显），頂部有肉髻。另外，斯坦因收集的像，耳垂特別大，不是筆直地向下，而是爲了不觸到肩，使耳垂朝外。<br>
            敦煌早期的石窟，特別是北魏時期的第259窟（參照《中國石窟 敦煌莫高窟》第1卷第25圖）中，有結定印的同類佛坐像，但其比例和表現上的處理方法，比此像更接近柏林的像。兩像當初都上過色彩，大概是因經過多少次的鑿刻，那彩色已被抹掉。像這樣，把斯坦因收集的此像，與其他像進行詳細比較觀察，則可以判斷出，此像的年代到底比其他像還要早些呢，還是因出自技術粗劣的作家之手呢？<br>

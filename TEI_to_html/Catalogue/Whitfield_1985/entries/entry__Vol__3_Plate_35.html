            Five Dynasties, 10th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Ink and colours on silk damask<br>
            52.5×51.7 cm<br>
            MAS 888 (Ch. xxi. 003)<br>
            This fragment shows how many of the banner headpieces were made by simply folding a square of silk and painting almost identical designs on the two sides. The width of the banner, as gauged from the diagonal, would have been some 70 cm; that is, even larger than largest banners now in the collection (Fig. 11, Pls. 15, 34; Vol. 2, Pls. 32-33). With the original purple silk border, already faded to brown when found by Stein, the total width of the headpiece was 3 feet (90 cm).<br>
            There is a selvedge along the top of the piece. The pattern of the silk is very large and fine; Stein thought that it was floral, but close examination shows that it is of phoenixes, the head and crest of one being just visible next to the upper Buddha, and part of the tail of another phoenix below. The silk itself must have been over 60 cm wide, perhaps as much as 70 to 75 cm. On the back, the pattern is slightly more distinct. An interesting feature of the painting is the strong yellow pigment, visible only from the back, applied beneath the flesh colour of the face and exposed shest of each of the Buddhas. The type of lotus seat, the symmettical disposition of the lotus stems, leaves and flowers, and the simplified depiction of the two Buddha figures all suggest a date in the tenth century.<br>

            五代時期，10世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            綾織、設色<br>
            52.5×51.7釐米<br>
            MAS888（Ch.xxi.003）<br>
            四方的絹沿對角線對折，在兩側繪大致相同的畫，是用於幡頭的織物，可能曾經製作過許多件。從對角線的尺寸看，幡的幅寬大約爲70釐米，比斯坦因收集品中現存的最大級的作品（Fig. 11，圖15、34，以及第2卷圖32、33等的幡）還要大。大概當時是紫色，斯坦因發現時，仍帶著已經變成茶色的絹邊，包括這部分在內，幡頭的幅寬可達3英尺（90釐米）。<br>
            斷片的上端還留著織邊。紋樣極大、極美。斯坦因認爲是花紋樣，而從現在所能看到的部分，可確定它是鳳凰。緊靠上方佛的右旁是頭和冠毛，下方佛的左側可見部分尾巴。此絹本身幅寬也超過了60釐米，恐怕可達到70～75釐米左右。從背面看，雖然是一點點，卻看得很清楚，還能發現畫像有趣的事情。之所以這樣說，是因爲小佛的頭和胸部等的膚色使用了黃色顔料，只從表面看，卻不能發現其強烈的黃色。從蓮華座的莖、葉、花是左右對稱的形式，以及小佛的簡略化的描繪等看，大概是10世紀的。<br>

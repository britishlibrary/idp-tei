            Tang dynasty, 8th – 9th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Silk gauze printed in jiaxie technique with outlines in ink<br>
            H. 34.4 cm, W. 11.0 cm<br>
            MAS 884 (Ch. xxiv. 009)<br>
            This piece must have originally hung in combination with other streamers, perhaps as part of a valance, since it seems too short to have been a streamer for a banner. Its design, of flowers and ducks, clearly relates it to other Tang dynasty fabrics such as the piece of embroidery in Pl. 3. The material itself is a plain alternating gauze (see the following plates). The decoration was printed using the jiaxie technique with ink outlines added afterwards by brush. The colours, however, have faded greatly. Along all the edges, the gauze has been neatly rolled and sewn with red silk thread. This was the usual way of protecting the cut edges of streamers and half widths of silk used as banners.<br>

            唐代，8～9世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            夾纈印染薄絹輪廓線為墨色<br>
            高34.4釐米 寬11.0釐米<br>
            MAS884(Ch.xxiv.009)<br>
            此作爲幡的幡尾過短，可能是與其他裝飾布組合，用作垂幕的一部分。其花鳥設計，與唐代的其他織物密切相關，如圖3刺繡。絹本身是無紋的羅（參照下圖）。紋樣是以夾纈的技法印染後，用墨勾勒。但整個色彩嚴重褪色。所有的邊都細緻地卷起，並用紅線鎖上。此是防止幡尾的邊以及裁成半幅絹的裁邊脫落而常用的方法。<br>

            3rd-4th century A.D.<br>
            From Niya<br>
            Painted wood<br>
            H. (from left)34.6 cm. 34.5 cm<br>
            1907 11-11 92 (N. xii.3)<br>
            Most of the ruins at Niya were dwelling houses, with large orchards containing different kinds of fruit trees. At one house, some three kilometers north of the ruined stupa at Niya, Stein excavated a rubbish deposit and found over two hundred and fifty documents on wood and leather. A number of these were wooden slips bearing a single column of Chinese characters, after the fashion of Han dynasty bamboo slip records. A date of A.D. 269 was subsequently found on one of these by Chavannes. The third-century date of the whole site was confirmed by his important discovery.<br>
            This pair of chair legs and a third leg from another chair were found in the corridor of a substantial dwelling house south of the ruined stupa. This house, N. Ⅳ (see Ancient Khotan, Pl. XXXI), was close to N. Ⅲ from which came the table in Pl. 60. Other finds from the same corridor include the head of a musical instrument (Fig. 72) and pieces of woolen carpet. In one of the adjoining rooms (N.x) there were numerous tablets in Kharosthi script, writing instruments and unused tablets.<br>
            Each of the legs has a human face-the left one female, the right male-on a bird-like body surmounting a horse’s hoof. Above the hoof, the leg becomes a half-open lotus on which the figure perches. The models for such hybrid forms were derived from India and the classical West. The side pieces of the seat frame were tenoned and mortised into the back of the heads, as seen in another chair leg from Loulan, where part of the seat frame survives (see Serindia, Pl. XXXIV). The hooked part at the top is not just part of the headdress but also served to secure a cushion.<br>

            3～4世紀<br>
            尼雅出土<br>
            彩色木雕<br>
            高34.6釐米，34.5釐米<br>
            1907 11—11 92（N.xii.3）<br>
            尼雅遺迹的大多數住居遺址，曾有過各種果樹的大果樹園。斯坦因發掘尼雅廢塔北邊房屋的垃圾堆，獲得了達250餘件木簡和皮革文書。那木簡大部分延續著漢代的形式，書寫一行漢字。其中包括沙畹後來發現有泰始五年（269年）紀年的作品，其重要的發現，確定了此遺迹是屬3世紀的。<br>
            本圖展示的兩個椅子腿，和另一件一起，在位於廢塔南邊富裕的居址的走廊發現的。被稱之爲N（尼雅）IV的此居址（參照《古代和田》圖版XXXI），緊挨著圖60的木雕家具腿部所出土的N.III址。從同一走廊發現的遺物中，還有樂器的頭部（參照Fig. 72）和毛織的墊毯斷片類。從鄰近的N.x.室中，發現多件佉盧文木簡和摻雜在其中未使用過的木簡。<br>
            本圖中的椅子腿的頂部表現的是，左方是女、右邊是男性的臉。同時，軀體像鳥的形態，下部是帶蹄子的馬腿形，兩者交界處是半開的蓮華形。以上的各種內容，摻雜了起源於印度和西方的內容。<br>
            頭部背後有榫孔，知道它插入橫木的組合方式。那種方式，在樓蘭出土的仍殘留著部分框架的椅子腿（參照《西域》圖版XXXIV）上，看得更清楚。頂部的鈎把手部分，不僅僅表示是冠，還起著固定椅子面的作用。<br>

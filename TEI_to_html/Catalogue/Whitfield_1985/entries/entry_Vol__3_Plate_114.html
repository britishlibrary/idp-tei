            Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.<br>
            From Ming-oi<br>
            Wood<br>
            H. 25.6 cm<br>
            MAS 1091 (Mi. xv. 0031)<br>
            This fine statuette and the carved and gilded segment of a vesica shown in the next plate were recovered from the same cella as the large Bodhisattva head shown in Pl. 101. The two wooden pieces had somehow survived the fire that had hardened and preserved the latter.<br>
            As Stein recognized upon finding the statuette, the Lokapala’s dress recalls that of the Lokapalas found among the Chinese paintings at Dunhuang (Vol. 1,Pls. 60-66), and the whole figure is certainly of Chinese workmanship. The various items of dress worn by such figures have been well described in Serindia (Vol. Ⅱ, p. 940), but there are certain differences worth describing here.<br>
            Usually the Lokapalas, or Guardian Kings, wear a coat of mail and a breastplate; here the coat, reaching from the shoulders and upper arms to just above the knees, is similar in length but has no indication of leather scales. The lower edge of this coat falls to a sweeping point between the legs and is hitched up to leave the knees free, exactly as seen in the paintings. A mantle covers the entire back of the figure, carved with a few simple folds, and is knotted across the chest beneath the chin. In the paintings (Vol. 1, Pls. 64-65) this mantle is black. In addition to the mantle, the statuette, like the paintings, has a stole, knotted in places, which hangs from the arms. (The hands and lower forearms, like the feet, are lost but can be seen to have been bent at the elbows like the joined hands of the Lokapala seen in Vol. 1, Pl. 60.) The girdle around the waist is of twisted drapery (some of the painted examples have a decorated leather belt), and a second flat girdle is wound twice around the chest, with the two ends tucked in and hanging from it. Enough remains of the legs to show that the figure wore leg coverings and greaves, the latter apparently of leather in shaped panels.<br>
            The statuette was originally painted, and a few traces of black paint still-remaining are noted in the description in Serindia. Part of the head and proper right shoulder are missing and show charring from the fire that consumed the temple. It is easy to imagine that there were originally many more wooden figures that did not survive.<br>

            唐代，8世紀<br>
            焉耆（明屋）出土<br>
            木雕<br>
            高25.6釐米<br>
            MAS1091（Mi.xv.0031）<br>
            此作工非常出色的小像和下圖展示的木雕鍍金背光，是從出土圖101中展示的大型菩薩頭的同一内殿發現的。儘管兩者都是木雕，卻竟然能逃脫了將菩薩佛頭燒硬的火災，保留至今。<br>
            斯坦因發現此小像，在看其衣著時，想起敦煌發現的絹繪天王像（參照第1卷圖61～66）的衣著，此像的確是通過中國人之手製造的。有關敦煌畫中天王像穿著的各種衣裝，在《西域》（參照第2卷940頁）中有詳細說明，在此主要對它們明顯的不同點加以敍述。<br>
            天王像通常著鎧甲和胸甲，而此像則從兩肩、上臂到膝的正上方，是基本與它們等長的上衣，見不到鎧甲的革制鱗片。<br>
            此像上衣的下端，與繪畫中所見的情況相同，下垂到兩腿間後擡起，使膝蓋能自由活動。刻著數條單純褶線的披風，恰好裹住像的整個背面垂下，正面可見胸前和顎下的繫結。繪畫（第1卷圖64、65）中，這種外套被繪成黑色。除了披風，與繪畫間有共同點的例子，還可舉出幾處繫結和從兩臂垂落的天衣（兩手、前臂、腳等已缺損，但在第1卷圖60中可見到天王像手合掌的樣子，天衣從肘部折曲垂下）。軀幹上纏著布擰的腰帶（繪畫中多是皮革腰帶）。胸圍上纏兩圈與此不同的平帶，兩端塞在裏邊垂下來。從兩腿的殘存部，可窺見此像帶著護腿和脛甲。脛甲表現的似乎是模壓的皮革製品。<br>
            這小像原曾上過彩，《西域》中記錄有黑顔料的痕迹。頭的一部分和右肩已殘缺，還可見此寺被燒毀時，火災燒焦的痕迹。不難想象原來曾存在過很多木雕像。<br>

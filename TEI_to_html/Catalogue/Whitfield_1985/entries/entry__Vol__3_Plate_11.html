            This banner is a companion piece to the last. A fragment of weft-faced silk with a design of flowers in bright grass green, red, and white on an indigo ground was carefully pieced together form the border of the headpiece on one side, and many come from the same material as that in the headpiece of the banner in Pl. 10. Another piece of weft-faced silk in the apex of the triangle has a design in red on a blue-green ground. Below it is a larger piece of warp-faced silk with a flower in salmon edged with grass green, flanked by two bands, each with five rows of salmon dots, arranged to form a lozenge shape around the flower. The back of this headpiece is lined with a faded purple silk damask with a lozenge pattern.<br>
            The three main panels follow the same order of colours as in Pl. 10. The top piece is plain blue silk; the second, white damask with a fine network of lozenges; the third, a “fine red woolen or cotton twill fabric” (Serindia, Vol. Ⅱ, p. 1012).<br>

            此幡和上圖的幡是一對。幡頭一側的邊上，小心謹慎地綴縫著深紺色底子上用紅、白色和亮草色織出花紋的緯錦片，此可能與圖10的幡頭下方使用的布片是相同的錦。幡頭三角形部分的頂點上，用的是與其它不同的青綠底上織紅色紋樣的緯錦。其下綴縫的是略大些的經錦，織出的是草色做邊的紅色花紋和五層菱形圍繞著它的紅色點紋。此幡頭的部分，用織有菱形花紋的褪了色的紫色綾做裏子。<br>
            幡身三種顔色的分配與圖10的幡相同，最上段是青色平絹、第二段白色是粗糙的菱格綾、第三段紅色的是“精美的紅色毛或棉的綾”（參照《西域》，卷2，1012頁）。<br>

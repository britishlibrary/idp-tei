            Plain fine silk and fine damask were used as well as gauze for the side and tail streamers of the banner paintings. The two lower pieces (Pl. 28-2) with patterns based on lozenges and on small floral spots show that some of the designs were also close to those of the gauzes, such as that shown in Pl. 23. The effects are obtained in the weaving, however, by reversing the warp and weft floats, which here cross three threads in the pattern and only one in the ground. Mistakes in both the warp and the weft stand out, especially in the upper piece of Pl. 28-2.<br>
            The design of the top piece (Pl. 28-1) is of a five-petalled flower between two symmetrically disposed leaves, repeated upside down so that the whole forms an elliptical motif. It resembles the flowers seen in some of the paintings, either as independent motifs or in altar vases. The pattern is in a 5/1 twill picked up in the warp threads on a plain ground.<br>

            幡的幡尾和幡腳，除了羅外，還曾使用過美麗的平絹或綾。下圖（28－2圖）的兩件是以四花紋和菱紋做基調，但它們也和圖23等中的羅的織紋相似。通常，綾的紋是通過正反面浮現經線和緯線來實現，而在此斷片上，在平織地上，花紋是由三根經線構成。經線和緯線雙方都有織錯的痕迹，特別是上方綾更顯著。<br>
            上圖（28－1圖）的花紋，是左右對稱展開的兩片葉子間配五瓣花，兩種紋樣的尾部連接，形成長橢圓形的花紋。在繪畫中也見到與此非常相似的花，並作爲獨立的內容，用於祭壇的淨瓶等上。地是平織，花紋部分成六枚綾。<br>

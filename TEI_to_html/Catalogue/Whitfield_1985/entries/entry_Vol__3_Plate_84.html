            Late 8th-mid-9th century A.D.<br>
            From Mazar-Tagh<br>
            Woolen felt with leather patches<br>
            L. 25.0 cm<br>
            MAS 495 (M. Tagh. A. 0041)<br>
            Mazar-Tagh, the “Hill of the Sacred Shrine,” is described by Stein as an isolated and striking feature of the Taklamakan, being a chain of hills extending northwest for about forty kilometers from the Khotan River. Its commanding position in an otherwise flat desert, on the only route crossing the desert northward from Khotan to Aksu, made it a natural frontier station for Khotan.<br>
            Coins found by Stein of the Kaiyuan (A.D. 713-42; but minted throughout the Tang), Qianyuan (A.D. 758-60), and Dali (A.D. 766-79) reigns, as well as Chinese records, bear witness to a Chinese presence in the eighth century, but the majority of the finds were made in the rubbish pits of the fort and date from the time in the late eighth and first half of the ninth century when Tibetan military power was asserting itself throughout the region. As at the Tibetan fort at Miran (over 700 miles away by road he observes), Stein found the rubbish deposits still pungent with filth, but full of evidence of the daily life and activities of the Tibetan garrison. Tibetan documents, numbering over a thousand, were the most abundant, but some records were written in both Khotanese and Chinese or Tibetan, showing the administrative need for bilingual communication. Objects found include numerous weapons, wooden seal-cases, wooden keys and locks, wooden dice for games, netting for catching fish in the flood season, and sandals and shoes. Many of the latter were of thick wool or felt, as the one shown here, and were a protection against the severe winter cold. The sole is stitched with close-set rows of hemp string: its edges are turned up all around the shoe, and are further protected by leather patches. The uppers are tightly stitched in a design of overlapping scales, and a draw-string would originally have provided a snug fit around the ankle.<br>

            8世紀末～9世紀中葉<br>
            麻紮塔格出土<br>
            毛、皮<br>
            長25.0釐米<br>

            關於有“聖地之山”意義的麻紮塔格遺迹，斯坦因所指的，是和田河向西北連綿約38公里的山丘，孤立在塔克拉瑪干沙漠中，體現出顯著特徵的遺迹。此地是和田向北方的阿克蘇，貫穿沙漠的唯一的交通道上，平坦的沙漠地帶中最具地利的，所以自然而然成爲于闐國境的駐屯地。<br>
            斯坦因從這裏發現了開元通寶（開元是713～742年，而開元通寶的製作一直延續到唐末），乾元通寶、大曆通寶等，它們與漢文書寫的文書類一同證明，8世紀時這裏曾居住著中國人。然而，發掘品的大部分是出土於寨子的垃圾坑，顯示着吐蕃軍勢力完全佔領該地是8世紀後半葉至9世紀前半葉的年代。據說，斯坦因在距米蘭遺迹約1000公里處發現吐蕃軍砦的垃圾場時，還是臭味撲鼻的狀態，但卻充分證明瞭那是吐蕃守備部隊進行日常活動的地方。<br>
            文書類中，吐蕃文的文獻爲數最多，總數超過1000件，另外于闐文和漢文或吐蕃文對照书写的文書也很多，可窥出因行政上的需要，並記兩國文字進行傳達。<br>
            發掘品中，有無數的武器和印章容器，木製鍵和錠，木製的棋盤，用於洪水季節的漁網，套鞋和靴子等。大多套鞋和靴子，爲了抵禦冬天的嚴寒，像在這裏所展示的那樣，用厚的毛織物或氈子做成。鞋底用麻線縫了幾行，其邊卷上去遮住側面，並貼上皮革作保護。從靴子側面到鞋幫，細細地衲著青海波狀紋，在腳脖處周圍仔細貼體地剪下。<br>

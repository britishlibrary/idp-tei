            Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Wood<br>
            H. 9.4 cm<br>
            MAS 853 (Ch. lvi.0011)<br>
            This small figure of a Buddha has been discussed by Françoise Denes (1976), together with two similar pieces in the Pelliot collection. The similarity in size and treatment of all three, lacking aureole or nimbus and with a fixing hole in the base, led her to suggest that they might have formed part of a larger group or of an altar. They could indeed have been small Buddha figures within the vesica or nimbus of a large image.<br>
            The summary nature of the carving of the Guimet examples led Denes to date the Pelliot pieces to the Tang dynasty or later, with comparisons with some of the Five Dynasties figures found at the Jinhua Pagoda in Zhejiang. In the British Museum piece, the carving is slightly more detailed, and the drapery forms show a typical Tang concern for plastic form. In addition, there are abundant remains of the original colouring in red and black. Whether it was a single votive offering or a part of a larger group, it would not seem right, in view of its stylistic elements, to date it later than the ninth century.<br>

            唐代，9世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            木材<br>
            高9.4釐米<br>
            MAS853(Ch.lvi.0011)<br>
            关于此小佛像，Francoise Denes有與伯希和收集品的兩件同類品間的關係（《集美美術館的木雕》）的論述。此三件的尺寸和技法都有共同點，哪一件都沒有背光，台座上有榫穴，從而她推測这些像曾是群像或構成供養台的一部分。事實上，可以充分考慮这些是大佛像背光或頭光上的化佛的可能性。<br>
            集美美術館的作品，雕刻非常簡略，於是，Denes與浙江省金華萬佛塔中發現的五代時期的作品做比較，認爲伯希和收集的像是唐代的或者更晚。大英博物館的像，雕刻稍細，衣紋製作方面等也顯示了唐代塑像的典型特徵。而且還留有當初赤和黑色爲基調的豐富色彩。姑且不論此像是獨立的像還是群像中的一身，看其風格，可能晚於9世紀的看法是錯誤的。<br>

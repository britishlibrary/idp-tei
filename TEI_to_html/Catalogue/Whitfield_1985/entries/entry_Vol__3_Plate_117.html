            Leaf from a portable Buddhist shrine<br>
            From Ming-oi<br>
            Wood, with traces of pigment<br>
            H. 28.2 cm<br>
            MAS 1000 (Mi. ix. 001)<br>
            Only a few wooden travelling shrines have been found in Central Asia, and each is full of interest and character. One, found by Le Coq at Gaochang (Le Coq, 1913, Pl. 57c; Along the Ancient Silk Routes, No. 105), still has the hinges that attached it to the back panel. It represents a single seated figure of Ksitigarbha holding a cintamani, and one can imagine that the whole shrine, when open, formed a triptych with a central Buddha flanked by Ksitigarbha on the left and another Bodhisattva, probably Avalokitesvara, on the right. Traces of polychrome decoration can still be seen on close examination. When closed, the three parts of the shrine would have formed a cylinder tapering smoothly to a point.<br>
            The shrine shown here is also the left-hand leaf of such a triptych, but it is considerably earlier than the Le Coq shrine (dated to the ninth century A.D.). Its earlier date is reflected in the subject matter as well as in style and arrangement. The cult of Ksitigarbha was a fairly late development of Mahayana Buddhism, but the scenes shown here are still very much concerned with Hinayana, the Lesser Vehicle. They are arranged in three registers. At the top is a standing Buddha with an attendant holding a parasol. The middle scene is the most important: on the left is a standing Buddha on a lotus flower, his hands in the same gesture of abhaya-mudra as the Buddha above; on the right, two kneeling figures are in attitudes of adoration, and a third figure is kneeling and is bent forward so that his head is touching the ground beneath the Buddha’s feet. The lowest register is divided into two small panels reflecting the quadrant shape of the leaf: on the left is a standing Buddha with staff, and on the right, where they would remain hidden unless the shrine were fully opened, are two kneeling male donors.<br>
            It is middle scene that can be identified, as the jataka of Sumati. The Buddha’s career as a Bodhisattva began when, as a Brahman student with a water pot, he worshipped the Buddha by scattering lotuses he had obtained from a young woman in exchange for a promise of marriage in their future lives; then, spreading his hair beneath Dipankara’s feet, he vowed to be a Buddha himself. Dipankara promised fulfillment of the vow and the kneeling youth rose into the air in a circle of light. The scene here, when compared with Gandharan versions in stone (cf. Foucher, 1905,Vol. 1, pp. 273-79), appears considerably simplified: the young man is seen spreading his hair on the ground, but neither acquiring flowers or scattering them.<br>
            Since the young woman who kneels behind the prostrate figure does not bear flowers, we cannot know if she is his future wife, Yasodhara, or merely one of the adoring figures also found in the Gandharan reliefs. Nor can we be sure if the other kneeling figure is another such figure, or the Bodhisattva a after rising into the air. In the top scene, the Buddha attended by a servant with a parasol is not identifiable, but might be Dipankara, on the point of entering the city of Dipavati where this event took place.<br>

            焉耆（明屋）出土<br>

            可隨身攜帶的木製佛龕，在中亞罕有發現，但每一個的特點都很有意思。其中勒柯克從高昌發現的一件（參照勒柯克《高昌》1913，圖57c; Along the Ancient Silk Routes, No. 105），其佛龕背板上還留著合頁，上面是一身手持寶珠的地藏菩薩坐像。原來，它在打開時，是以佛爲中心，左邊的是地藏菩薩，右邊的大概是觀世音菩薩的另一菩薩，採用的是三個面連接的形式，關閉時，三個部分可合成圓筒形，上部是細尖狀。<br>
            這裏展示的佛龕，也是那種三面中的左側部分，但是可能要比勒柯克的要早（勒柯克的佛龕屬9世紀）。這不僅從風格和排列上，地藏菩薩信仰也是在大乘佛教相當晚的時期才開始盛行，這裏見到的情景，還殘留著濃厚的與小乘佛教有關的色彩。場面被分割成三段，上段是攜帶持華蓋侍者的立佛。中段最重要：左側的蓮華座上面，與上段的佛一樣結施無畏印而立，右側是合掌的兩身跪像，其前方是伏在地上，頭幾乎觸到佛腳的像。最下段被隔開成兩個小區，使人想到四分儀的形狀：左半部分有持杖的佛立像。右邊的部分，不把佛龕完全打開則無法充分看清，有兩身跪著的供養人像。<br>
            中段可以判斷爲善慧童子本生，佛在前世還曾是菩薩的時候，善慧童子作爲持水罐婆羅門的修業僧，向年輕婦人買花供佛，在燃燈佛腳下散髮立下成佛的誓願。比起犍陀羅石造雕刻（Foucher,，1905，第1卷273～279頁），這裏表現的情景相當簡單。表現了年輕人在地上散髮的場景，而沒有表現買花以及供奉的事情。<br>
            伏在地上的年輕人的正後方，沒有跪著手持花的年輕婦人，所以不清楚那婦人是不是他未來的妻子耶輪陀羅，或只是在犍陀羅浮雕中出現的一個崇拜者。另外，也不清楚其後方跪的另一身像也是相同的崇拜者，還是光之中站立的菩薩。對于上段的由持華蓋的侍者伴隨的佛也很難加以判斷，也許是燃燈佛進入此事發生的燈光城時的情景。<br>

            Tang dynasty, 8th – 9th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Ink and colours on silk<br>
            H. 6.5 cm, L. 40.0cm<br>
            MAS 1128<br>
            This fragment, perhaps originally part of an ornamental border, was not actually catalogued by Stein, but there is no doubt that its provenance is Dunhuang. Probably the interest of this piece only emerged when it was unfolded; it may have been used as a streamer, and has clearly been cut from a longer and wider piece for such a purpose. The design is of birds flying up towards a stupa or a flaming jewel. One bird is preserved almost complete, and suggests a hoopoe, though without a crest. Of the others only small parts are visible, enough to show that two birds on each side were flying up to the central motif. They were drawn in ink with very light and fluent touches of the brush and then coloured. The drawing of the floral scrolls in the corner of the piece is equally rapid and light-hearted, so that the whole fragment has a character unique among the textiles from Dunhuang.<br>

            唐代，8～9世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            絹，設色<br>
            高6.5釐米 寬40.0釐米<br>
            MAS1128<br>
            此斷片可能是絹飾的一部分，斯坦因的記錄中沒有記載，但它確實是敦煌出土的。其紋樣的産生，有意思的是沒有使用折疊的形式，其形狀也許是用於幡尾，裁斷更長更寬的絹而成的。圖案爲鳥向寶珠或塔類物飛翔的樣子。一隻鳥大致完整的保留下來，好像是沒有冠毛的戴勝。其他，雖然都非常小，卻能認出兩隻鳥的尾巴和嘴，是從兩側飛過來的。這些是用流利的淡墨線描出的，加了淡彩色。左端是花，唐草紋樣，同樣也是用麻利輕快的線描表現出來的。因而，此斷片在敦煌攜來的染織中，也呈現出了極獨特的情況。<br>

            From Yotkan<br>
            Pottery<br>
            H. 12.4 cm<br>
            MAS 2 (Yo. 1)<br>
            See also Fig. 100<br>
            The lower half of this small figure is missing. There is a hole through the mouth, and it has been suggested that it may have once served as a container for unguents. This however seems rather unlikely; this figure is chiefly interesting as one of the rare figures in human form from Yotkan, where the commonest items are masks and small animal figurines, especially monkeys, as seen in the following plates. The straight-cut fringe and the almost total absence of the forehead give a rather startled appearance to the face, and Stein described it as a “curiously rude and primitive looking work.” The eyes, opened wide, are given a double outline for which an Indian origin should perhaps be sought. The hair falls symmetrically onto the shoulders and onto the upper back with a central plait (cf. Fig. 100). At the front, below the necklace, a pair of shallowly incised lines appear to mark the hemline of a blouse or inner garment, with a central brooch or fastening (Stein took this to be a ribbon with a jewel, leaving the breasts bare). Below the raised line of the belt, the figure is broken off, and it is not easy to imagine what form it might have taken.<br>

            陶器<br>
            高12.4釐米<br>
            MAS 2 （Yo.1）<br>
            參照Fig.100<br>
            此小像下半部分殘缺，口上打的洞通向體內，可能是裝油的容器。而比起這一點，此作品中最讓人感興趣的那些地方，也見於下一圖及其後的，小的人面像和動物像，特別是約特幹的猿等雕塑類中。此件是表現人像的非常珍貴的作品之一。額髮筆直，幾乎見不到額頭的臉部相當突出。對於此，斯坦因說“的確很粗野，給人以原始印象的作品”。睜得很大的眼睛，用印度雕刻流行的兩層線來表現。頭髮左右對稱地披在兩肩，後頭中央的頭髮被編在一起（參照Fig. 100）。胸口裝飾物下用兩條淺的刻線表示罩衫或汗衫的邊，其中心有胸針或扣子一樣的飾物（斯坦因認爲，是皮膚上挂著有吊墜的鏈子）。外衣到腰部，表示腰帶的突帶以下已殘缺，完全不知下部分是什麽形態。<br>

            Tang dynasty, 8th – 9th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Complex patterned silk gauze<br>
            22-1:9.0×10.3 cm<br>
            22-2:10.0×10.3 cm<br>
            22-1: MAS 954 (Ch. 00437)<br>
            22-2: MAS 904 (Ch. 00344)<br>
            The effects of exposure to light can clearly be seen on these pieces of gauze. Originally each must have been one of a series of overlapping pointed tabs on a valance streamer, such as that in Pl.8. The diagonals were folded first to form the point, then the edges were folded back. A similar tab covered all but the most faded portion. In Pl. 22-2 exposure to light has caused not only fading but destruction of the fabric along the folds where were not covered. Where the folds were covered, little or no damage has resulted from the folding alone.<br>
            The two fragments combine the complex alternating gauze with different techniques to form a pattern. In pl. 22-2 (cf. the streamers on the banner shown in Vol. 2, Pl. 31), the gauze is of a type known since the Han dynasty: it has narrow lozenges whose edges are formed in the plain gauze. The tab shown in Pl. 22-1 is of a thicker material, very closely woven, and a part of a much larger design is seen at the upper right in the plain alternating technique with its denser, less open effect. For several streamers of similar gauzes, see Xinjiang chutu wenwu, Pl. 160.<br>

            22－1：9.0×10.3釐米……MAS954(Ch.00437)<br>

            在這兩塊斷片中，因陽光照射而褪色的部分，清楚地露出箭頭狀的紋。這可能如圖8展示的垂幕中也看到的那樣，是用作箭頭狀的垂飾。先將布料兩側斜折，使頭部形成尖狀，再把兩側的部分往裏折。然後，將相同形狀的在其上依次重疊。因此，露在表面的那部分褪了色，其餘部分的顔色保存下來，形成現在的狀態。圖22－2不僅因陽光照射褪色，還可看出沿折疊線的破損。那說明這部分是暴露在外邊的，上面覆蓋的其他布塊幾乎不見沿折疊線的破損。<br>
            這兩件斷片中，可見各自使用不同技法的織紋。圖22－2（參見第2卷圖31）細長菱紋的技法，漢代起就已被人所知。圖22－1的是織法緻密的較厚織物，右上端可見大概是利用填充線孔平織出的大型紋樣的一部分。《新疆出土紋物》圖版160中有數例同類紋羅的幡尾。<br>

            6th-7th century A.D.<br>
            From Dandan-oilik<br>
            Painted stucco<br>
            H. 34.7 cm, W. 28.5 cm<br>
            British Museum,1907 11-11 62 (D. II. 34)<br>
            This fragment is from the smaller of two cellas of Shrine Ⅱ at Dandan-oilik excavated by Stein on his first expedition in 1900-1901. It is especially valuable since it is one of the few fragments that show how the small moulded figures, common among the finds made at many Central Asian sites, were originally used.<br>
            Shrine Ⅱ at Dandan-oilik consisted of a large and a small cella, each with its entrance on the north. The larger shrine had contained a larger than life-size figure of the Buddha standing on a central pedestal, but of this figure only the feet survived, just covered by the sand that buried the shrine to the height of a few feet. In the small cella, measuring about three and a half metres by two and a half, the main figure was a seated one, on a massive base against the south wall. A fragment of the face showed that it was more than life-size, and two lions flanked the base on which it sat. The small figures shown in this plate, and other similar figures, were found in the top layers of the sand covering the base. All of them, Stein concluded, “belonged originally to plaques which probably in the form of aureoles had adorned the uppermost part of the south wall” (Ancient Khotan, Vol. I, p. 249).<br>
            The individual Buddhas stand in abhaya-mudra, and are placed on a dark grey background on which are also painted lotuses, although these are now hard to discern. As can be seen from the plate, the figures were first moulded and then attached to the background by a pad of clay. They are painted in red and have green aureoles, and white faces, hands and feet. The moulded border was also painted in the same colours, alternating dark grey, red, green and white. One lotus flower moulded in relief and attached to the same ground also survives.<br>
            We can thus assume that many other such small standing figures, each moulded and about 15 cm high, found at various sites, were also used in the same manner. Two such figures from the Trinkler Collection, found at Rawak and now in the metropolitan Museum, New York, still hold their colouring well and are similarly placed on a background painted dark grey.<br>
            The main image in Shrine Ⅱ was flanked on one side by a large statue of the Guardian King Vaisravana, clad in a coat of mail and trampling on a demon. Below the platform, Stein found four painted wooden plaques, evidently votive offerings by the last worshippers at the shrine. Although the paintings on them were almost entirely lost, Stein later found other such painted plaques in the other shrines at the same site, a number of which are illustrated here in Pls. 66-71<br>

            6～7世紀<br>
            丹丹烏里克出土<br>
            彩塑<br>
            高34.7釐米,寬28.5釐米<br>
            英國博物館，1907 11－11 62（D.II.34）<br>
            此斷片是斯坦因於1900年至1901年間第一次探險時，從丹丹烏里克第II寺址二殿中的小殿獲得的。可證明中亞諸遺迹出土的相同造型的小像原來是如何使用的，因此極其珍貴。<br>
            丹丹烏里克第II寺址由大小兩殿組成，每個入口都在北面。大殿中央的基壇上曾有超過真人大的佛立像，現只剩此像的脚部，被埋于室內堆積高數英尺的沙子中。3.5m×2.5m的小殿裏，緊接南壁的基壇上安置有佛坐像。根據頭部斷片推斷是超過真人的像，基壇上蹲著兩頭橫向的獅子。本圖的小像和其他同類像都是從埋沒基壇的沙子表層發現的。斯坦因推測，這些“本來都是裝飾南壁上端，大概是背光的裝飾板”（《古代和田》，卷1，249頁）。<br>
            結施無畏印的兩身佛立像，是安置在暗灰色的背板上，板上曾繪有蓮花，現很難分辨。從圖版上也能明白，像先是用模子製作，再填上粘土安裝到背板上，衣服是赤色，背光用綠色，臉、手和脚用白色上彩。背光的邊緣也是用模子做的，用暗灰、赤、綠、白色交叉搭配組合，板上粘的模制蓮花還殘留了一朵。<br>
            根據以上的例子，可以推測從其他諸遺迹發現的，每個都是15cm左右的用模子製作的小立像，都是使用同一方法製作的。Trinkler發現于熱瓦克，現藏于紐約大都會美術館的兩身像，色彩保存良好，也是安裝在塗成暗灰色的背板上。<br>
            第II寺的本尊，一邊是身披鎧甲、踏著邪鬼的大毘沙門天像。斯坦因從基壇下發現了有彩畫的四片木製裝飾板，可能是最後的信徒捐贈此寺的遺物。儘管那些繪畫幾乎全部消失，但斯坦因後來從同一遺迹的另一寺址携來了同樣的木版畫，已將它們展現圖66～71中。<br>

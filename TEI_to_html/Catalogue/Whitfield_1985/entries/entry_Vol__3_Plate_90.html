            Dated A.D. 571<br>
            From Astana<br>
            Clay with incised and painted characters<br>
            H. 38.5 cm, W. 40.0 cm<br>
            British Museum,Ast. 09<br>
            This tablet was brought to Stein by villagers of Astana. It is one of five memorial tablets which he took to London, three of the others having been found in situ in the tombs. Still others, which he reburied together in the entrance passage to one of the tombs (Innermost Asia, Vol. Ⅱ, p. 1032), have recently been recovered in a Chinese excavation (Wenwu, 1975/7, p. 10, Figs. 5, 6), six of them with his identifying numbers still intact.<br>
            In common with others found at Astana, this tablet substitutes clay tile for the stone commonly used in North China for muzhiming. Various colour combinations are used for the inscriptions and the ground on which they are written, red on black being a favourite combination. The present example is alone in having the characters deeply carved as well, their style still recalling that of the Northern Wei in its forthright character. Particularly noticeable is the wedge-like appearance of the strokes, especially the angled strokes. Such features are directly comparable with several of the early sixth century inscriptions in the Guyang cave at Longmen (cf. Shodo zenshu, Vol. 6, Tokyo, 1966, Pl. 43ff). The orthography of certain characters also shows features that can be paralleled in Northern Wei epitaphs, as in the distinctive form of character Yuan in the name of the deceased (cf. ibid., Pl. 151). Not surprisingly, this tablet is the earliest of the dated tablets found by Stein. The inscription, first translated by Henri Maspero (Innermost Asia, Vol. Ⅱ, Appendix A), reads as follows:<br>
            Yanchang, 11 th year, xinmao, third moon beginning moushen, eighth day, yimao, epitaph of the Administrative Counsellor, later Superior Administrator in the Board of Population, Wang Yuanzhi, posthumously entitled Senior Secretary.<br>
            Other tablets of later date (Figs. 114-16) are simply written with the brush, in red on black, black on white, or red on blue, while their writing styles range from running script to a more formal lishu with each character placed in its own ruled square or rectangle. The surface, especially on those with a white or blue ground, is prone to abrasion, and, with the exception of the tablet shown in this plate, all have suffered considerably since their discovery.<br>

            延昌十一年（571年）題記<br>
            阿斯塔那出土<br>
            著色磚銘<br>
            高38.5釐米,寬40.0釐米<br>
            大英博物館,Ast.09<br>
            此墓誌是斯坦因從阿斯塔那的村民那裏獲得的。包括此墓誌在內，斯坦因帶回倫敦的墓誌共有五種，其中三塊是從墓室內發現的。除此外，最近中國的考古隊也發現了斯坦因埋回墓道（參照《亞洲腹地》，卷2，1032頁）的墓誌（參照《文物》1975年第7期，10頁，插圖5、6），其中六塊上有斯坦因標的號，很清晰。<br>
            中原的墓誌按慣例一般都採用石材，而此墓誌與阿斯塔那出土的其他墓誌一樣採用磚。墓誌的銘文和磚的底色間色彩配合有各種各樣的，黑地上配朱書似乎特別受喜愛。本圖的例子是唯一一塊將碑文刻得很深的墓誌，同時，純樸的筆風使人想起北魏的書體。特別惹眼的是楔形筆法，有棱角的部位隨處可見。這種特點使人立刻想起龍門石窟古陽洞6世紀初的若干題記（參照《書道全集》第6卷，圖版42以後，東京，1968年）。另外，若干文字的特點，如死者姓名中的“元”字的字形等，明顯與北魏墓誌有類似之處（上揭書，圖版151）。實際上此墓誌在斯坦因發現的墓誌中是最早的。馬伯樂最早譯釋了這件墓誌銘（《亞洲腹地》第2卷附錄A），全文如下：<br>
            延昌十一年辛卯歲三<br>
            月朔戊申八日乙卯諮<br>
            議參軍轉民部司<br>
            馬追贈長史王元祉（？）<br>
            之墓表<br>
            年代稍晚的其他墓誌（參照Figs.114-116）只用筆寫的，有黑地朱書、黑地白書、青地朱書等例子。書體從行書體，到一字一字寫在整齊劃出的方形或長方形的格子中的隸書體，各種各樣的。墓誌表面，特別是白地或青地的容易磨損，除有題銘的本圖中的墓誌外，其它的在發現當時就已經破損嚴重了。<br>

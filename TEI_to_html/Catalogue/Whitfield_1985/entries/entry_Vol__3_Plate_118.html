            From Khora<br>
            Wood, painted and gilt<br>
            H. 31.0 cm, L. 53.5 cm<br>
            MAS 983 (Khora. IV. i. 002)<br>
            Although darkened and difficult to make out, the scenes shown on this fragment are of particular interest. It is the only item in the Stein Collection to show the Buddha preaching to disciples, in a style that is close to that of the wall paintings from Kizil.<br>
            This is a fragment of a wooden beam, most of the back of which has been pared away to reduce its thickness for transport. The top edge overhangs the painted scenes, and is decorated with cruciform florets of gold leaf. Below the scenes was a close-set row of grotesque lions, separately carved and dowelled to the main piece. Only two survive, having been recovered detached. With forepaws crossed in front of them, manes hanging either side, and a chevron band running down the chest, they have a most distinctive appearance, and match almost exactly two lions with heads turned from Tumshuk in the Pelliot collection (Musée Guimet, EO. 1350, 1351; Mission Paul Pelliot Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Toumchouq, Vol. I, Pl. 271-2).<br>
            In contrast, the painted scenes are extremely fine in execution, in rich colours and gold but very much darkened, so that Stein only reproduced the two lions in Serindia. Despite the darkening, the graceful forms of the seated Buddhas (one inclined to the right and the other to the left, and each surrounded by a crowd of divine worshippers) can easily be made out. The arrangement is almost identical to that of some of the wall paintings at Kizil, such as the two registers of preaching groups in Cave 17 and Cave 14. There too the preaching scenes are placed immediately below the projecting cornice from which springs the semicircular vault, and are divided by pearled borders, here done with small squares of gold leaf.<br>
            The Khora shrines were free-standing and not cut into a cliff as those at Kizil. Although the remains Stein recovered from these shrines are scanty (see Pl. 119), they are enough to show their early date and character as closely associated with the style prevalent in Kucha in the fifth and sixth centuries A.D., before the influence of China was strongly felt.<br>

            已經發黑，很難判別，但此斷片上表現的場面卻非常有意思。形式與克孜爾壁畫的說法圖很相似，表現佛給弟子說法場面的作品，在斯坦因收集品中只有這一件。<br>
            這是木梁的斷片，裏面大部分被削去，很薄，易於搬運。上端向前突出，有用金箔作成小花的十字紋裝飾。繪畫部分的下方，排列著單獨雕刻後用釘子固定上的怪異獅子。發現時，已經脫落，通過修復，現在保留下來兩隻。<br>
            兩旁垂下長長的鬃毛，胸毛用連續的山形紋表示，前肢交叉放在胸前。此獅子獨特的姿態，與伯希和從圖木舒克所獲的兩只頭向側面的獅子(參照集美美術館EO.1350、1351，伯希和調查團《圖木舒克》第1卷，圖版271－2)的表現大致相同。<br>
            與此相比，涂了金彩，用丰富的色彩精細描繪的繪畫，卻變得太黑，因此斯坦因除了两頭獅子外，其餘未刊載在《西域》中。然而，即使是變黑，但也能很容易分辨出（左和右边的身體略歪的具優美姿態的佛坐像，和圍繞他們的供養天部）。配置如克孜爾第17窟和第14窟的說法圖等克孜爾的若干壁畫幾乎相同。在那裏，這種說法圖也是在突出的中楣正下方，從中楣開始是山洞狀的天井。各說法圖被联珠纹的邊隔開，而在本圖中，是用小的方形金箔隔開。<br>
            霍拉的佛寺建於平地，並不是如克孜爾那樣在懸崖上鑿窟的形式。斯坦因從這佛寺僅發現了少量的遺物（參照圖119），但其年代早，它們身上具備的特質，可看出與尚未深受中國影響之前的5至6世紀庫車地區廣爲流傳的風格有密切關係。<br>

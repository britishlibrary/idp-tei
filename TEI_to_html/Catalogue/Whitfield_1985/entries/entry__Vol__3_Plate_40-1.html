            Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Warp-patterned compound double weave<br>
            40-1: 27.0×26.0 cm<br>
            40-2: 21.9×8.0 cm<br>
            40-3: (left; two fragments) H. 16.5 cm each<br>
            (right) 15.7×11.0 cm<br>
            40-1: MAS 862.a (Ch. 009)<br>
            40-2: MAS 862.b (Ch. 00359.a)<br>
            40-3: MAS 865 (Ch. 00230)<br>
            MAS 863 (Ch.00359.b)<br>
            See also Fig. 14<br>
            These fragments are from at least three separate banners. The largest was the headpiece to a ninth-century banner (Ch. 009; now in New Delhi) representing a standing Bodhisattva holding a hand censer (Serindia, Pl. LXXIX). The fragment shown in Pl. 40-2 with the same design was used with the fragment at lower right to form another headpiece. Finally the two smaller fragments, in the same kind of weave, are from a number of miscellaneous cuttings found by Stein.<br>
            In the two upper fragments the colours and indeed the whole fabric have been excellently preserved, although the sewn-on silk border and bamboo stiffener have been removed from the large piece since it was described in Serindia. The design is typical of those of Sasanian origin, with confronting deer inside large pearl medallions, and confronting geese in the spaces left between the rows of medallions. The colours are arranged in pairs so that four colours are generally in use in any one part of the weft: this would mean a separate shuttle for each of the five colours used (pink, green, white, yellow and red). The resulting bands of colour are even more apparent on the back of the material.<br>
            MAS 863, lower right, is a fairly small fragment, but enough remains to give a good idea of the pattern, which is of two confronting ducks within a green medallion with rounded corners. The ground is salmon pink, which has faded considerably except where it was once sewn in a seam. On the back of the piece, which is in plain weave, the mixing of the colours can be seen: the two unused colours running together while a third is pulled up to the front. There was also a yellow motif in the spaces left between and above the medallions, now barely visible through fading. This was probably a border pattern.<br>
            This type of fabric has commonly been described as weft-faced, both in Serindia and in subsequent publications, most recently by Xia Nai (though with some reservations) in an article in Kaogu Xuebao and reprinted in Kaoguxue he keji shi (pp. 96-97), and by Yamanobe Tomoyuki (1981). The most complete study of this group of textiles with medallion designs is that by D.G. Shepherd (D.G. Shepherd and W.G. Henning, 1959), which is referred to in the notes to Pl. 6, and which suggests that such silks may have been made in Sogdiana around the seventh century A.D. Among the many items in the group, the pieces shown in Pls. 40-1 and 40-2 have preserved the original colours best, whereas in other pieces, such as those in the borders of the sutra wrapper shown in Pl. 6, the colours have generally faded considerably, in that case having originally been “dark green, changing in arbitrary bands to dark blue, a true chartreuse, bright rose-pink, orange and white” (ibid., p. 26).<br>

            參照Fig.14<br>
            本圖所展示的五件斷片，來自至少三件不同的幡。最大的斷片（圖40－1），現藏於新德里國立博物館，用於繪著持香爐菩薩立像的9世紀幡（參照Ch.009,《西域》圖版LXXIX）的幡頭上。圖4 0－2的斷片有相同的圖案，但是另外的幡的幡頭右下部分。圖40－3左邊的兩件小斷片，是從斯坦因收集的無數斷片中選出的，其織法與上述兩塊相同。<br>
            上段的兩件斷片（圖40－1、40－2），收錄於《西域》之後，將曾縫合在一起的邊和竹芯等取下來單獨保存，包括色彩，保存狀態均極好。圖案是典型的起源于薩珊波斯的設計，聯珠紋中有一對相向的鹿，聯珠紋的列與列間配相對的鵞紋樣。爲了使每個部分的緯線都能用四種顔色，每兩色爲一組來使用。這或許是粉、綠、白、黃、紅五色線都使用各自的梭。其結果是織出的色帶，在背面看得更清楚。<br>
            圖40－3右端的是小斷片，但大致能想象得出其紋樣結構。綠色圓中配一對相向的家鴨，地色雖已褪色，但隱藏在縫合線下面的顔色仍能保留下來，知道原來是淡紅色的。地子的組織是三層經線，其中的一色組成表面，另兩色沈在裏面。六角形的空間和上方空間是黃色的紋樣，現在已褪色，基本看不清了。此斷片所見的紋樣，大概處於整體紋樣的上端。<br>
            這種形式的錦，無論是在《西域》中還是之後的出版物中，都被稱作緯錦。刊登在《考古學報》上，後又重登於《考古學和科技史》上的夏鼐先生的論文（參照北京 1979年，96、97頁）以及山邊知行先生的『シルクロ－ドの染織』（京都1981年）等，近期的文章中也都那樣認爲。關於有聯珠紋的這種染織品，最出色的研究，是曾在圖6中參考的D.G. Shepherd的論文（D.G. Shepherd and W.G. Henning, 1959），那裏說這種絹是7世紀時織於粟特地區。衆多例子中，圖40－1、40－2中展示的斷片，鮮明地留下了當時的色彩，其他的，經帙（圖6）的絹邊褪色嚴重。據說，當初也見到後者有“從深綠到深紺色的亮麗色彩以及淡黃綠色、亮玫瑰色、橙、白等顔色”（參照同書26頁）。<br>

            Tang dynasty, 8th-9th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Silk embroidery<br>
            Left: 28.5×7.0 cm<br>
            Right: 14.0×6.0 cm<br>
            From left: MAS 912 (Ch. xxvi. 003), MAS 915 (Ch. 00347)<br>
            As with the small Buddha (Pl.2), the larger of these pieces of embroidery is on gauze, which in turn is backed with a fine silk, both originally pink. The pink, once close to that of the flower petals, has only survived well in areas protected from light, as on the back of the fabric behind the embroidered motifs. Stein assumed that the gauze was cut away around the design, but it is much more likely that it simply fell away in time from these background areas. It is most clearly visible around the antlers of the deer at the bottom, and at the top where the extremity of another motif appears. From its position near the selvedge of the silk, this may be the tail of an animal, perhaps a dragon. In one or two places, the preparatory ink outline is visible on the gauze; the ink did not penetrate to the plain silk support.<br>
            The smaller fragment, one of three found by Stein (another is illustrated in Serindia, Pl. CX), is embroidered on a glazed black damask with a fine diaper of concentric lozenges. It was, as Stein notes (ibid., Vol. Ⅱ,p. 989), “apparently cut from [a] band, 1 3/4 ″ [45 mm] wide, for which [the] embroidery was designed.” The half-florets are arranged alternately along the sides of the band, those on one side being edged with a 1-mm strip cut from paper covered with gold leaf, those opposite similarly treated, but with silver instead of gold leaf on the paper strips. The gold strips were couched with pink thread and the silver with white; one may be sure that the prominent banded effect due to the silver having tarnished to dark grey was not originally intended.<br>

            唐代，8～9世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            刺繡<br>
            左：28.5×7.0釐米<br>
            右：14.0×6.0釐米<br>
            從左，MAS912（Ch.xxvi.003）.MAS915(Ch.00347)<br>
            此兩塊刺繡斷片，大的和小佛像斷片（參照圖2）一樣，用精美的絲綢做裏子，在薄沙上刺繡，當時表裏可能都是粉色的。花瓣上見到的近乎粉色，多是在絹地的裏側及刺繡之下等少見陽光的地方。斯坦因推斷刺繡周圍的薄沙是被剪斷的，但考慮是因時間推移而殘失會更恰當。此現象，從最下端的鹿角周圍更能看清楚。另外，從上邊只露出的另一種圖案的末端，也能看出。那圖案是動物的尾巴，也許是龍。能見到一兩處薄沙上的底樣墨線，此墨線沒有染到裏子的平絹上。<br>
            小塊斷片是斯坦因在敦煌發現的三件作品之一（其他的見《西域》圖版CX），有光澤的深紺色綾底上，左右方向交錯繡著紜繝的半花紋。據斯坦因的記錄（上揭書，卷2，989頁），“很明顯，是把帶刺繡的裁出幅寬約有45毫米的帶狀”。半花紋從兩側交錯出現，一側用了1毫米寬的金絲做邊，而另一側的則用同寬的銀絲做邊。金絲用淡紅色線，銀絲用白線固定，現在銀色變成灰暗色，當時它增加的華麗效果是不可想像的。<br>

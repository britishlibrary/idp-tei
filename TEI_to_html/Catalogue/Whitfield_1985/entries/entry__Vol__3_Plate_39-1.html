            (39-1) As Stein concluded from the remains of paper backing found adhering to this fragment, it was probably once used as the border of a sutra roll cover, such as the ones shown in Pls. 6 and 7.However, it is not satin twill as he described it, but a double cloth in plain weave on both sides. Since there is no selvedge, it is not possible to distinguish the warp and weft in this piece. There are two types of rosettes in alternate rows, one row having a quadripartite centre with six broad petals, the next having a centre with six smaller petals with six larger petals emerging between these from beneath. The design as well as the technique is less sophisticated than some of the other figured silks with floral patterns, and one is tempted to suggest a date earlier than the Tang dynasty for this piece.<br>
            (39-2) This narrow strip is shown here more than twice life-size. It is a warp-faced damask double cloth, and the technique is similar to that of the piece in Pl. 37. The pattern is in a thick untwisted yarn, which may be the warp, although Stein believed that the warp was the fine yarn. The pattern is very pretty, and manifestly Sasanian in inspiration, with two green ducks exhibiting brown crowns and yellow eyes, wings and bills, confronting each other on a paler field within each medallion of brown with white spots. Adjacent medallions touch each other and those in the rows above and below at the four cardinal points. At these points and in the spaces between the medallions are small six-petalled rosettes.<br>
            Despite the Sasanian inspiration for the design, the piece is, as Stein observed, undoubtedly of Chinese manufacture and stands apart in closeness of texture and in fineness of yarn from other pieces of Sasanian style such as the borders of the sutra cover shown in Pl. 6, which are altogether broader in design. Stein also drew attention to the similarities between this piece and the piece in Pl. 41-6, for which he drew numerous parallels with textiles and silver patterns preserved in the Shoso-in.<br>
            (39-3) This piece is a double cloth with plain weave on the back and a reverse twill on the front, giving a very fine and accurate lozenge pattern overall on this side. There is a selvedge with cut ends, perhaps because the weft was so brittle. It is hard to imagine this fine yarn, too brittle for a warp, being tied, and in fact it has been basted with gold thread to hold it together. The design on the front is of individual florets, each of six small white spots with a seventh for the centre, set on small brown squares.<br>
            The fragment originally served as the suspension loop for a banner of a late ninth century Bodhisattva (Ch. lv. 006), and the pattern is clearly discernible in Serindia (Pl. LXXX), where the banner, now in New Delhi, is shown complete with its streamers, headpiece and this hanging loop.<br>

            （39－1）此斷片發現時，還粘著做裏子的紙殘片。因此，如斯坦因推斷的，或許是用於像圖6及圖7中展示的那種經帙的邊絹。但不像他所說的緞紋綾，而是平地錦。沒有織邊，無法分辯此斷片的經線和緯線。地是織成四個條紋的縞，其上交叉配有花紋。一排花紋的花芯是六瓣，另一排的是四瓣，均被六瓣稍大些的花瓣圍住。比起其他有花紋的錦，圖案、技法都缺乏精心考究，從這一點，不是可以覺得此斷片比唐代的作品還早嗎？<br>
            （39－2）是一件非常窄的斷片，按原尺寸看不清紋樣，所以圖版中擴大了約2.7倍。是與圖37的技法相同的錦，斯坦因認爲其經線是細線，但紋樣是使用未撚的粗線織出的，大概是經線。紋樣非常美，明顯有薩珊王朝時期的波斯風格，加白點的褐色圓中，有兩隻身爲綠色，頭爲褐色，面部、翅膀、嘴爲黃色的相向的家鴨。每個圓都與兩邊和上下的圓相連，四個連接點和圓之間形成的間隔中，加了小的六瓣花紋。<br>
            儘管其圖案具薩珊波斯風格，但正如斯坦因也指出的，勿庸置疑它是中國製造的織物，猶如圖6中展示的經帙的邊，在絲線的粗細和織眼的方式等方面，與作爲整體圖案更大的其他薩珊風格的錦類，都有很大不同。斯坦因也注意到了此斷片和圖41－6斷片的相似處，引用了很多正倉院中流傳的染織品以及銀器上所見的類似紋樣加以說明。<br>
            （39－3）綾地錦，整個表面都可見整齊美麗的同心菱的地紋。此斷片有織邊，也許是緯線太易壞，邊都已折斷。實際上考慮到此細的經線過於脆弱，爲了增加強度用黃線鎖了邊。從正面看，可確認其圖案爲中心配一個、周圍六個小白點的花紋，居在褐色小的方形中。<br>
            此斷片本來是繪有菩薩像的9世紀後半葉的幡（Ch.lv.006）的吊環，在《西域》圖版LXXX中展示，現收藏於新德里國立博物館的幡腳、幡頭以及此吊環等齊備的此幡的完整形狀，可清楚看到吊環部分的紋樣。<br>

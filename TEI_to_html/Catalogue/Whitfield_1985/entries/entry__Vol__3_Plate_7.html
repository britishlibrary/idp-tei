            Tang dynasty, 7th-8th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Bamboo and silk<br>

            MAS 859 (Ch. xx. 006)<br>
            Like the wrapper shown in the preceding plate, this served to protect a number of sutra rolls. The wrapper is made of bamboo splints held together by bands of silk decoration formed by twined silk. There are three more wrappers from Dunhuang in the Pelliot collection in Paris (Tissus de Touen-houang, Pls. 1,3 and 4). Other better-preserved wrappers of similar construction are in the Shoso-in Treasure House at Nara (Treasures of the Shoso-in, Middle Section, Pls. 27-31). Some of these are very much more elaborate in their decoration, as is appropriate to their original purpose, but all are similar in size, in the principles of their decoration and even in some of the motifs.<br>
            In all of these, the construction is similar, with a weft of split bamboo, and they were probably woven by exactly the same method still employed in Japan for the construction of screens for papermaking.1 The warp threads are in pairs of different colours, twined with a Z-twist. Tension on the back brings one colour or the other of each pair forward as needed to form the pattern. The index character yin 陰 near the edge is formed separately by twining two threads of different colours back and forth, over the free ends of the bamboo splints.2 Finally, the edges were protected by a further pair of twined threads and by binding the edges with paper, fragments of which remain attached to the bamboo splints.<br>
            These features can be better seen on the examples in Paris. The whole of the back was also lined with paper. The decoration consisted of variations on the baoxiang, or precious-flower motifs, between broad and narrow bands, the wider bands being between 23 and 25 mm wide, and the narrower ones between 8 and 10 mm. The bamboo weft is visible in the spaces between. The same arrangement can be seen in one of the Shoso-in examples (ibid., Pl. 29),which has also lost its lining cloth and border of brocade. Another Shoso-in wrapper has stripes of even width (ibid., Pl. 28). On a third (ibid., Pl. 31), the decoration is basically organized in stripes, but the weaving entirely covers the bamboo weft. In the most elaborate of the Shoso-in examples (ibid., Pl. 27), two colours only, purple and white, are used to form a large design centering on two medallions, each with a kalavinka at the centre, surrounded by a grapevine scroll, outside which is the text of an Imperial order for the distribution of the Suvarnaprabhasa- sutra to official state monasteries dated the 14 th year of Tempyo (A.D. 742). The whole of the design, including the characters of the inscription, is formed by bringing one or the other colour forward. From these examples in the Shoso-in we can see that the edges of such sutra wrappers were commonly protected with a brocade binding and that they were fastened by a central tape of the same, with diagonal braces. It is interesting to note that, on a humbler scale, wrappers woven from split bamboo are still associated with writing today in East Asia, being used to hold writing brushes.<br>
            1 The photographs (from Sukey Hughes, Washi: The World of Japanese Paper, Tokyo, 1978, Pls. 235-36) show how the bamboo splints are added working upwards and how the threads are individually tensioned.<br>
            2 In the case of one of the Pelliot wrappers (EO.1200), it has been suggested that the creation of the inscription was a veritable “tour de force,” since the bamboo weft had to be already in place (Tissus de Touen-houang, p. 5). However, since the ends were open, the operation as described here was actually quite simple.<br>

            唐代，7～8世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            竹、絹<br>
            高43.0釐米 寬26.8釐米<br>
            MAS859(Ch.xx.006)<br>
            与上圖的經帙相同，用於包裹若干卷子做保護。此經帙是將削好的細竹用絹絲編織而成，絹絲部分成了帶狀的裝飾。在巴黎伯希和收集品中，從敦煌攜來的此種經帙有三件（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的染織》圖版1、2、3），奈良正倉院也收藏有同樣製作的經帙，保存狀態更好（參照《正倉院寶物 中倉》圖版27～31）。這些中的幾件不仅適應當時的使用目的，又有格外精美的裝飾。不過它們所有的尺寸和基本裝飾都大致相同，甚至部分紋樣也有共同點。<br>
            以上所列舉的，在製作方面也很相似，採用了竹籤充當緯線的相同編法。它們與日本直到現在編織用於漉紙的漉簀所使用的方法相同。經線變色的部分成Z狀扭曲，從背面拉拽調整，顔色或出現在表面上，或出現在相反位置上，從而産生紋樣。一端上側所見到的“陰”字，與纹樣部分不同，是兩色合起來撚成的線織出來的。兩端安有寬的竹片，夾上紙，用上邊的每兩股撚成的線來固定，一部分紙仍保留至今。<br>
            此件比巴黎的特徵更明顯，其背面全用紙裱糊了。紋樣從寬到窄，各不相同，但無論哪一種都是寶相花紋樣的變形，寬的有23－25毫米，窄的也有8－10毫米。這些紋樣帶之間，竹籤充當緯線。與此完全相同結構的也見於正倉院寶物（上揭書，圖版29）的一件作品上，但裏子的布和錦邊飾等也都佚失。正倉院的其他經帙（上揭書，圖版28），紋樣帶寬度都較均勻。第三個（上揭書，圖版31），基本裝飾是縞紋樣，充當緯線的竹子全用線纏著。正倉院中最爲漂亮的（上揭書，圖版27），是中央配有迦陵頻伽，周圍環繞著只用紫和白色表現的兩個大的葡萄唐草的圓形花紋。此紋樣的外側，一邊繡著“依天平十四年（742年）歲在壬午春二月十四日敕”，另一邊繡著“天下諸國每塔安置金字金光明最勝王經”的文字（此紀年與其他史書所記載的天平十三年的紀年不一致）。包括此題記部分，整體圖案都是由兩種顔色對比構成的。看這些正倉院的諸例子，與在這裏所展示的經帙，原來也和上圖的作品一樣，通常是用錦做邊，中央部位的系帶也是相同的錦帶。而非常有趣的是，尺寸稍小，但與它們一樣用線編的竹籤，至今在東亞各國仍將其作爲捆捲毛筆的工具。<br>

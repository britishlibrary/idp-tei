            Tang dynasty, 7th-8th century A.D.<br>
            From Darabzan-dong, near Domoko<br>
            Painted stucco<br>
            H. 21.0 cm<br>
            MAS 452 (Dar. 008)<br>
            The ruined site of Darabzan-dong, first investigated by Stein in the autumn of 1906, was under irrigation only two years later, so that his finds remain as the only record of this and other sites. These finds were scanty: fragments of wall painting with remnants of cursive Brahmi script, and two stucco heads modeled in high relief, of which this is one. They were all close in style to the finds made at the shrines of Khadalik, only four kilometers to the north, and Stein concluded that the shrine from which they came had been abandoned at about the same time (towards the end of the eighth century) as both Khadalik and the more distant site of Dandan-oilik.<br>
            The head, modeled on a clay and fibre backing, and hollow as it was originally set on a wooden core, is close to the stucco heads found at Karashahr, and the upper part of the headdress originally resembled that of one of the figures from that site (see Pl. 96).<br>

            唐代，7～8世紀<br>
            達拉布贊墩（達瑪溝近郊）出土<br>
            彩塑<br>
            高21.0釐米<br>
            MAS452（Dar.008）<br>
            1906年秋，斯坦因首次對達拉布贊墩遺迹進行考察，之後僅兩年，因灌溉用水的泛濫而塌壞。因此，斯坦因的收集品，是此遺迹的唯一遺物。收集品不多，只有可辨出草寫婆羅謎文的壁畫斷片，和兩件高浮雕佛頭等，本圖的作品是其中的一件。另外，它們的風格與以北約4公里的喀達裏克遺迹出土的物品近似。斯坦因推測，該寺址也和喀達裏克和丹丹烏裏克相同，是8世紀末被遺棄的。<br>
            此佛頭，是在纖維質上塗抹粘土造型的，背後的洞提示當初曾裝有木芯。與焉耆（明屋）出土的佛頭非常相似，頭飾上部殘缺的部分，可能原來也和焉耆發現的一個塑像（圖96）相同。<br>

            The first of these two figures was brought to Stein from a desert area in the extreme north-west of the inhabited portion of the Khotan district. When he visited the place in Apod 1908, he found no structural remains but enough finely modeled relief fragments to leave “no doubt that they were the remains of the stucco relief decoration of two Buddhist shrines separated from each other by about 160 yards [146 metres]” (Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, p. 1273).<br>
            Both these figures show the Buddha standing in abhaya-mudra, with flames issuing behind the shoulders, and nimbus and (in Pl. 62) mandorla with floral border edged in flames. Like the figures (Pl. 55) from Khadalik, they must have been placed within the vesica of a large statue. (Plate 73 gives an idea of the arrangement.) Parts of the background to which they were attached can still be seen, and there is a pad of stucco serving to fasten them to it. The background material includes abundant traces of straw to bind it together, but the figures themselves are of a very fine quality. According to investigations made for Stein by Sir Arthur Church (Serindia, Vol. Ⅲ, Appendix D), after moulding, the figures were gently baked to harden them, and then coated with a very thin layer of pure white gypsum to give them a porcelain-like finish and colour.<br>
            In style, these figures, like the remains from the Rawak stupa, are not far removed from the art of Gandhara, only slightly flatter. The triangular “tongues of flame” are a sign of extraordinary or heavenly power: an excellent example of a standing Buddha carved in stone, complete with flames issuing from his shoulders and waves beneath his feet, is illustrated by Alfred Foucher (La Vieille Route de I’Inde de Bactres à Taxila, Paris, 1947, Pl. XIa) and reproduced by Kumagai (1962, Fig. 121). The greater plasticity of the Gandhara stone carving is especially evident in the drapery folds and in details like the flames, which have in the moulded figures become mere triangular points conforming with the limited space left between the shoulders and the nimbus.<br>

            兩身佛立像中，圖61展示的，是斯坦因從和田地區的居住區域偏西北方向的沙漠中帶回的。1908年4月，斯坦因探訪此地時，已無法辨出建築物的結構，卻獲得了多件用模子作的精美浮雕斷片。據斯坦因說，“這些半浮雕裝飾物，顯然是相隔約140米的兩座佛寺址的遺物”（參照《西域》第3卷1273頁）。<br>
            結施無畏印的這兩身立佛，哪一個都是從肩後放出火焰，其上是頭光，而且圖62的身光有帶花紋的邊，其外側有火焰圍起。和先前展示過的喀達裏克的佛立像（圖55）相同，大概這兩身像也是安裝在大佛背光上的。圖73上可見到一個這種配置的例子。那裏還殘留著一部分安裝佛像的背板，能見到上面的像用灰泥貼上去的樣子。爲了提高背板材質的結合力，摻入了大量的槁草。根據爲斯坦因進行調查的亞瑟·邱吉爾先生講（參照《西域》第3卷附載D），這些像，是用模子製作後，慢慢燒结，上面用極薄的純白石膏粉飾，做的像瓷器一樣，並上了彩。<br>
            風格上，除了略粗這一點，和熱瓦克佛塔出土的像相同，沒有脫離犍陀羅雕刻的影響。肩上三角形的火焰象徵著超自然的力量。在富歇的著作（參照《從大夏到呾叉始羅的印度古道》圖版11a）和熊谷宣夫博士的論文（參照《西域文化研究》第5卷所收的《西域の美術》插圖121圖）中，刊載過兩肩同樣有火焰，足下是波浪的完整的石雕佛立像優秀作品。犍陀羅石雕像出色的造型，主要顯示在衣褶線及火焰等細部的表現上，而模子製作的像上，因爲肩和頭光間僅有極小的空間，所以火焰成了小的三角形。<br>

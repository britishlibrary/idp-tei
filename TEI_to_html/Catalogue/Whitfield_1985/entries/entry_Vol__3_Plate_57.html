            From Endere<br>
            Painted wooden votive plaque<br>
            H. 11.8 cm, W. 13.3 cm<br>
            1907 11-11 143 (E. ii. 1)<br>
            At desert sites near Khotan, Stein found a number of wooden votive tablets: this is one of the smallest. The smooth panel has its top and bottom edges beveled front and back, and is therefore complete despite its small size. The ground was prepared with an initial layer of white. Ganesa is seated, wearing a tiger skin dhoti. Small florets in white are scattered on his trousers and over the cushion on which he sits: other florets occur on the white ground at the edges of the panel.<br>
            The deity has four arms, the two upper ones holding a spearhead and an axe; the two lower hands hold his bowl of rice or jewels, and an item identified by Stein as a “long-shaped turnip,” though the last is no longer clear enough to be certain, and might equally well be a flower, since it has a curving stem ending in a pointed bud. The centre of the vesica was originally green.<br>

            木板畫<br>
            高11.8釐米 寬13.3釐米<br>
            1907 11－11 143（E.ii.l）<br>
            斯坦因從和田附近沙漠中的遺迹發現多件木板畫，本圖是其中最小的作品之一。板的表面平滑，反正面和上下邊均作了處理，儘管很小，卻不是斷片，可看出是完整形狀的作品。表面整個用白色做了地，其上作畫。象鼻神纏著虎皮腰布而坐。褲子和坐墊子上散著白色的小花紋，畫面兩邊的白色地上也見有其他小花紋。<br>
            象鼻神有四臂，上方的兩臂持槍的穗尾和手斧，據斯坦因說，下方的兩臂持“盛果品的器皿（？）”和“長的鏑”，而此“鏑”不是很清楚，似乎在彎曲的莖頭上有帶尖的蕾，視它爲花更合適。背光的中心部位原來可能是綠色的。<br>

            From Ming-oi<br>
            Painted stucco<br>

            MAS 1069 (Mi. xii. 0025)<br>
            This finely modeled figure of the head and neck of a camel is from the same passage (xii) behind the cella (xi) from which, as we have seen, other pieces survived untouched by fire and with some of their original colouring intact (cf. Pl. 98). In this piece, too, some of the original pink colouring survives, as well as the wooden guide-stick inserted through the nostrils. The modelling is extremely naturalistic, but is still combined with moulded appliqué pieces for the shaggy hair of the neck. The large bundle of reeds that served as an armature in building up the figure has survived and can be seen projecting beyond the modern mount at the back. Such bundles of reed, spirally bound with string, formed the core of all the stucco figures found at the Ming-oi site, but they have generally been burnt away, leaving only a clear impression.<br>

            從頭到脖子部分都很好看的模製駱駝像，是從内殿（xi）後方的通道（xii）攜回的，在那裏還發現了先前所見的，沒遭火災，仍較好保留著當時色彩的作品（參照圖98）。此像上也殘留著相當多當時的淡紅色彩，兩鼻孔裏留著牽拉用的小木棍。模型表現非常寫實，脖子下面是使用模子做的亂蓬蓬的毛。用作像芯的葦束，突出在後邊的後來才安裝的板子端上。用繩子螺旋式捆成的這種葦束，用在從明屋遺迹發現的所有泥像芯上，但大多已經完全被燒毀，只留下其痕迹。<br>

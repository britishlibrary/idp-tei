            From Ming-oi<br>
            Fragment of moulded tile<br>
            H. 16.4 cm, W. 14.3 cm<br>
            MAS 1092 (Mi. xvi. 001)<br>
            This fine head represents a different aspect of the decoration of the temples at the Ming-oi site. Whereas much of the decoration was of moulded stucco figures that were only accidentally fired in the destruction of the temples, both this piece and the nearly complete clay tile shown in the following plate may have been given a proper even firing before use. The present example is one of seventeen fragments found by Stein in a small recess (xvi) next to the cella (xv). Its walls were bright red as if it had been used as a kiln, and the tiles were found thrown together in a heap, though here too there were signs of a subsequent accidental burning. As the head and the decoration of the tile are almost the same as that in Pl. 112, they will be discussed together in the next entry.<br>

            6～7世紀<br>
            焉耆（明屋）出土<br>
            模製磚斷片<br>
            高16.4釐米 寬14.3釐米<br>
            MAS1092(Mi.xvi.001)<br>
            此漂亮的菩薩頭部，作爲明屋遺迹的佛寺裝飾，顯示出特殊的容貌。然而，明屋用模子作出的泥像，大半因毀壞佛寺的火災受到燒煉，但本圖的菩薩頭部和下圖展示的基本完整的磚相同，似乎是用極細的粘土做成，使用前原就進行過燒煉。本圖的菩薩頭部，是斯坦因從鄰接小屋xv的壁龕xvi發現的17個斷片中的一個。那壁似曾作爐子使用過，變得通紅，磚堆積成山，都有經歷過後來失火的痕迹。此磚製頭部及其裝飾結構，與圖112中磚的情況幾乎相同，因此在下圖集中解說。<br>

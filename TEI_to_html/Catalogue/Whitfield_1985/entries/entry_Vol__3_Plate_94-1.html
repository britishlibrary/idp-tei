            Tang dynasty, mid-8th century A.D.<br>
            From Astana<br>
            Pastry<br>
            H. (from upper left) 7.0 cm, 6.0 cm, 10.5 cm, 5.2 cm, 6.5 cm, 4.7 cm<br>
            From upper left, 1928 10-22 123 (Ast. iii. 1. 018), 128 (Ast. iii. 2. 034), 130 (Ast. iii. 2. 037), 132 (Ast. iii. 2. 042), 125 (Ast. iii. 2. 068), 124 (Ast. iii. 1. 024)<br>
            Some of these fancy pastries were found in the same tomb, Ast. iii. 2, as the large figure of a horse (Pl. 91). In another tomb of the same group, Ast. iii. 1, about a hundred of these offerings were all that remained of the contents, having apparently survived intact on the coffin platform despite the previous robbing of the tomb and the removal of the wooden coffin as well as any trays or dishes on which the pastries might have been originally placed. Those shown here include triangular wafers with their centres made up of sections of different-coloured coiled pastry, a large bow-shaped pretzel and a more elaborate openwork, probably made in a mould. Some of the flower-shaped tartlets retained traces of jam in the centre, or of fruit such as a grape. Some black grapes were found as well, and other pastry shapes included small cubes, straws, buns and twists. For other well-preserved examples of pastry from Astana, see Xinjiang chutu wenwu, Pls. 179-82.<br>

            唐代，8世紀中葉<br>
            阿斯塔那出土<br>
            麵點<br>
            上段左起，高7.0釐米，6.0釐米，10.5釐米<br>
            下段左起，高5.2釐米，6.5釐米，4.7釐米<br>
            1928年 10－22 123，128，130，132，125，124（Ast.iii l.018,2.034,2.037,2.042,2.068,1.024）<br>
            本圖麵點中的四個，是和先前的大型馬俑（圖91）一同發現于阿斯塔那第iii區2號墓。另外，儘管第iii區的1號墓遭盜掘，棺和供物器皿被拿走，但棺床上仍留下了100餘個幾乎沒有受損的麵點。本圖展示的麵點，有中心加有不同顔色的旋渦狀的三角形薄餅、大蝶形的麻花餅、大概是用模子加工的有精美透孔的菓子。花形小餡餅中，有若干隻中心加的果醬或葡萄及其他果物仍原封不動保留下來。其餘麵點的形狀，有小立方體、麥稈形、麵包卷形、麻花形等。阿斯塔那出土的炸麵點中保存較好的還可見《新疆出土文物》（參照179～182圖）。<br>

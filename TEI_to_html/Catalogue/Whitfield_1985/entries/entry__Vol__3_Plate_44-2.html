            Tang dynasty, 8th century A.D.<br>
            From Dunhuang<br>
            Silk tapestry<br>
            Second piece from left: L.9.0 cm<br>
            From left: MAS 906 (Ch. 00166; two fragments),<br>
            MAS 908 (Ch. 00301; two fragments), MAS 907 (Ch. 00300; single fragment)<br>
            Despite their small size, all of these fragments of kesi tapestry are the full width as originally woven. The two pieces on the left are the same as the longer strips decorating the sutra cover shown in Pl. 6, although the colours are preserved much brighter and there is some variation in the size of the individual motifs.<br>
            The two middle fragments are wider but, as can be seen from the plate, coarser than the rest. The pattern is of spots and pairs of half-spots, on a salmon pink ground. From the wear at the top ends it would seem probable that the piece these fragments belonged to was used, as was the next fragment, as a suspension loop for a narrow banner.<br>
            The strip on the right, once as a suspension loop according to Stein, now measures almost 19 cm, and is of very fine workmanship. An additional strip with five warp threads and a repeating paper spot is sewn on to one edge. Its warp threads, like those of the two middle fragments, are Z-ply, while those of the main piece and those on the left are S-ply. Not only are the warp threads set very fine and close (there are 31 of them in all, and only 25 in the wider middle fragments), but what now appear as white dots are in fact paper strips covered in gold, similar to those used in the silk embroidery of Pl. 3. Unnoticed by Stein, the strips are woven in as rosettes of four petals at the top of each spot and in the centre; but the two middle elements of the spot were outlined in gold. Although the gold has rubbed off the outer surface, traces of it can still be seen with the aid of a microscope. The original brilliant effect of gold sparkling in the centre and around the edges of each spot can easily be imagined.<br>

            唐代，8世紀<br>
            敦煌出土<br>
            錦<br>
            從左第二：長9.0釐米<br>
            從左二片MAS906（Ch.00166），次二片MAS908（Ch.00301），右端MAS907（Ch.00300）<br>
            雖然是小斷片，但是這些斷片體現出它們本來的織面。左邊二片的顔色保留良好，內容大小雖然有差異，與圖6中展示的經帙中央位置所使用的細長錦相同。<br>
            中央兩片，從圖版中也能明白，其面比其他斷片寬，織孔也粗。紋樣是淡紅色的地上交叉配花紋和半花紋。看其上端破損的部分，和下一片相同，可能是用於幡的吊環上。<br>
            據斯坦因說，右邊的斷片是曾用作吊環，長約19釐米，其製作極其精美。經線非常細密（這裏共用了31根，而中央稍寬的斷片僅用了25根），現在看似像個小白點的，實際上是金線，這和圖3刺繡上使用的相同。斯坦因沒有設及到這一點，但此金線，除在四個花瓣的頂部和花紋中心，作爲點紋織入外，還用在中央兩個花瓣的邊上。外側的金已剝落，但用顯微鏡現在仍能看到其痕迹。根據中心位置和紋樣邊上殘留的白點，也能想象出其原來使用金時的美麗輝煌。<br>

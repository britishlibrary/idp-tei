            The colours in these two fragments have been much better preserved than the colours in some of the other fabrics printed in the same technique, thus giving an excellent idea of what some of them may have looked like originally. Of more importance, however, is that the smaller of the two fragments (Pl. 17-2) clearly shows a mirror reflection of the pattern. The fineness of the fabric made it possible to fold and then print several layers at one time. The folded material was clamped between two boards pierced with holes, all of which were plugged except for those required to create the pattern in each colour as the assembly was successively immersed in the dyeing tanks. Three colours-blue, yellow and red- were used in the printing, the blue combining with the yellow to produce green and with the red in the hexagons to make a purplish brown.<br>

            夾纈印染絹<br>
            17－1：17.0×9.1釐米<br>

            此兩件斷片顔色的保存狀況，遠比其他夾纈斷片好，這讓人追念當時其他作品也曾經有過這樣美麗的顔色。但是，比這更珍貴的是，小塊的斷片（圖17－2）中，讓人更清楚地看出折疊線與重復紋樣間的關係。因爲絹薄，折疊幾層後夾在板子間，一下子就可印出多個文樣。在夾折疊絹的兩塊板上按紋樣打出孔來，印染時，只將染料浸透各色需要打開的洞。印染此絹時，用了青、黃、紅三種顔色，青和黃色重疊的部分是綠色，而那些加了紅色的六角形部分，呈現出了帶紫色的茶色。<br>

              "This title, appearing on line x (plate 5) is ascribed to Lang Zhiben, Sima of Xuzhou and Companion of the Prince of He (ie. Li Yuangui, son of Tang Gaozu). Preceding the text is a selection of graphic variants with phonetic and semantic glosses drawn from the ""<span class="bibit">Ziyang</span>"" (<span class="bibit">Models of the Written Word</span>) by Yan Jian. The "<span class="bibit">Zheng ming yao lu</span>" segment that follows is organized under six categories: correct but slightly peculiar forms with footnotes giving common forms; correct forms, with footnotes giving divergent, popular forms; correct forms in regular script (""kaishu"") with footnotes giving slightly divergent forms; graphic analyses of ondividual and related words; pairs of graphic variants reflecting ancient and contemporary usage; and semantic distinctions of homonyms. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ZhouZumo_1988: Zhou Zumo 1988:45-7</a> concludes that Yan Jian compiled his text sometime between 649-704 whereas Lang 's work can be dated to ca. 636-49."<br>

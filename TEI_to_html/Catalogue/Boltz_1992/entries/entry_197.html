              "Charter setting forth the aims and objects of a women's club. Approved by fifteen women who were restating their commitments at new year. Members, many of whom were nuns, pledged contributions of food and drink should the families of any of them fall upon hard times. Similar support was also promised on the death of any member. All agreed to a New Year's assessment of millet, lamp oil, and seal impressions of a stupa, to requite the benevolence of the emperor and ensure the good fortune of their parents.

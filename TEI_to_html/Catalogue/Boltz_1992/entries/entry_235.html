              "Almanac for AD 978. The almanac is incomplete although the framework for the whole has been traced out. The opening column of text indicates that Wang Wentan ordered its compilation on the basis of the official almanac issued by the Bureau of Astronomy. The almanac's outstanding feature is the depiction of Jupiter surrounded by twelve figures representing the animals of the duodenary cycle, which animals are depicted in their hats. There are also four guardian figures in the corners. "<br>

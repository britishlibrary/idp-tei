              "New Reflections of Letter-Writing Protocols. This text gives sample letters for announcing the death of one's wife to her parents and uncles, and to the shangha or Daoist clergy on the death of an abbot. Expression of condolence and appropriate responses are also prescribed according to the relation and age of the deceased. The prayers recorded in closing are to accompany offering on behalf of one's parents' internment and on the sealing of their tomb. "<br>

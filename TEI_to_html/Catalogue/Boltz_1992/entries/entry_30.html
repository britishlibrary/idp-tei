              The text centres on the monk Shi Sengren 's response to the criticism of an anonymous Minister of State for seeking to heal the injured by injuring himself. Shi justifies his copying of a sutra in blood to relieve the adversity suffered by Military CommissionerLi by contrasting Huayan teachings with what he deems to be the injurous practices of Riujiao and Daojiao.

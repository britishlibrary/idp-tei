This title is in any case derived from a fragmentary inscriptionat the end of the ms. which lacks either designation. The text itself, reportedly drawn from the <span class="bibit">Suvarnaprabhasa sutra</span> (see <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

Vaisravana 's role as a national guardian is popularly traced to the Tang emperor Xuanzong 's victory in 742 over foreign tribes through an application of the rituals of Vaisravana recommended by Amoghavajra. Hong Bian held the post of Chief Sangha Controller of Hexi from Dazhong 5 to 7 (851-853)."<br>

A short history of the transmission of Buddhism to China follows, beginning with the arrival in AD 67 of Kasyapa Matanga and Dharmaratna in Luoyang. The remainder of the text is devoted to notes on various mountains, from Mt. Wutai to Mt. Hua, with tabulations of monasteries and their residents. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

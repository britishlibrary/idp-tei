      <p>"The Tale of Master Yuan of Mount Lu" (Lu shan Yuan gong hua) is one of numerous
                manuscripts Marc Aurel Stein (1862-1943) procured from Dunhuang in 1907. Numbered
                Stein 2073 the manuscript is written in two hands on coarse, whitish paper. A
                colophon notes that the text was copied by Zhang Changji in the fifth year of the
                Kaibao era (972). The manuscript is now housed in the British Library, London,
                United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>The main character of this story is the eminent monk Huiyuan
                (334—416), known for his contacts with contemporary gentry, exchanges with the
                usurper Huan Xuan (369—404), correspondence with the renowned translator Kumarajiva
                (344—409/413), and his teaching of dhyāna(meditation) practices at Mount Lu in
                Jiangxi Province from 373. Huiyuan emphasized the importance of worshiping Amitabha
                Buddha, who presides over the Western Paradise, and is famous for his essay "A Monk
                Does Not Bow Down before a King" (Shamen bu jing wang zhe lun). In his youth,
                Huiyuan diligently studied the Confucian classics and was particularly fond of
                Taoism. Thus he was broadly learned, not only in Buddhist precepts, but in
                traditional Chinese thought as well.</p>
      <p>Another eminent monk mentioned in the
                text is Daoan (312—385). Daoan was one of the most influential Buddhist
                personalities in China during the Eastern Jin period (317—420). He stressed the need
                for vinaya (monastic rules of discipline) and immersed himself deeply in the study
                of prajñā-pāramitā (intuitive wisdom) literature. And, whereas Huiyuan encouraged
                the worship of Amitabha, Daoan had organized a cult to Maitreya, the Buddha of the
                future.</p>
      <p>It is curious that, in real life, Huiyuan was a disciple (in fact, the
                favorite pupil) of Daoan, and it was his encounter with the latter in the year 354
                that made him turn to Buddhism in the first place. In the present tale, however,
                Huiyuan is depicted as though he were the teacher of Daoan. Consequently, we can
                safely assume that "The Tale of Master Yuan of Mount Lu," which dates to more than
                half a millennium after the lifetimes of its protagonists, must have been composed
                for the sectarian purpose of elevating Huiyuan and his partisans over Daoan and his
                adherents. There are also many other aspects of the tale that are at odds with
                historical reality, such as the name of Huiyuan's teacher mentioned in the second
                paragraph, his capture by the bandit Bo Zhuang, his servitude to Prime Minister Cui,
                the displacement of a birthmark on Daoan's arm to Huiyuan's, his alleged authorship
                of an enormous commentary on the Mahāparinirvāna-sūtra, and so forth.</p>
      <p>Without
                going into elaborate detail, the probable source of the massive distortions in "The
                Tale of Master Yuan of Mount Lu" is roughly determinable. First of all, in his
                Treatise on the Three Rewards (San bao lun), Huiyuan did write about nirvana, the
                central doctrine of this tale. Furthermore, he had a disciple named Daosheng who
                concentrated heavily on the Nirvāna-sūtra and was one of its strongest advocates.
                Now, when written quickly (in "grassy" style), the Chinese characters for Daoan and
                for Daosheng look rather similar. Thus it is quite likely that some early author had
                penned an attack on Daosheng (Huiyuan's student) for having appropriated Huiyuan's
                ideas on nirvana and that his sloppy calligraphy resulted in the transfer of his
                critique to Daoan (Huiyuan's teacher). To complicate matters further, there was
                another, later Huiyuan (523-592) who was—like Daosheng—also a staunch advocate and
                well-known exegete of the Nirvāna-sūtra. A contemporary of his, Tanyan (d. 588),
                indeed, wrote a huge commentary on this sutra in fifteen scrolls, and it was this
                commentary that was most influential as a guide to the text during the period when
                our tale was composed.</p>
      <p>Regardless of their origin, the legends embodied in
                this tale were still being widely circulated as late as the fourteenth century, when
                Buddhist historians denounced them as false depictions of Huiyuan and Daoan. Despite
                all of the historical inaccuracies and legendary aspects of "The Tale of Master Yuan
                of Mount Lu," however, this fascinating narrative is valuable for its vivid
                description of medieval Buddhist lectures and debates. Finally, in terms of the
                development of narrative, this is the longest sustained tale to have appeared in
                China up to the time when it was written.</p>
      <p>The following translation is based
                directly on a very close reading of the original Dunhuang manuscript. As such, it is
                occasionally different from all modern published versions of the text. The
                discrepancies result from factors such as the following: where to break sentences;
                where to insert punctuation; how to divide up words; how to interpret graphs that
                are sloppily written, erroneous, out of order, interpolated, omitted, or rubbed out;
                and so forth.—TS, VHM</p>

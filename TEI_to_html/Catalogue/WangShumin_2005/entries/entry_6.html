              For a description of P. 3287, please see Abstract 2. The scroll contains five books in 149 columns of text.This text, the last in the sequence, occupies columns 67-149. As the original title and the author’s name have not survived, it has been given the descriptive title above.<br>
              Although the text cannot be dated with precision, it is likely that it was composed around the same time as Wangmingshi maijing, I, i.e. during the Six Dynasties period. The MS is contemporary with Sanbu jiuhou lun (see above), and probably dates from the reign of the Tang emperor Gao Zong 高宗.<br>
              The treatise opens with the words ‘You wen 又問…’ (Again [we may] ask…), indicating that a preceding passage has been lost. The surviving text contains an account of the nineteen categories of pulse, followed by a description of normal and abnormal pulses proper to the four seasons of the year, and a separate discussion of the characteristic properties of each of the nineteen pulses together with relevant therapeutic techniques.<br>

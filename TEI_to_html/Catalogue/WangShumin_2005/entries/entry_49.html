              The MS is 14.5 cm. high and 40 cm. long. The top, bottom and first section are lost, and the title, headings and author ’s name are missing. The remaining fragment contains the bottom half of 25 lines. The text, which appears to come from a general treatise on materia medica in the preface genre, is identified as Wangmingshi bencao xulie (Prefatory material to the Pharmacopoeia author’s name lost). It is too badly mutilated to permit reconstruction as continuous prose.<br>

              The bottom and end of the scroll are damaged. It contains 78 columns of text. It discusses ‘Shi’er shi zhong de bing ri tui kan ji zhi qing-zhong 十二時中得病日推勘即知輕重’ (the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases according to the stage in the twelve-fold division of the day at which the patient became ill) and ‘mou zhi ri bing gui xingming 某支日病鬼姓名’ (the names of the disease-bearing spirits proper to times and seasons). Although this work enters the realms of superstition, the descriptions of pathologies and the names of sympathetic remedies are a valuable source for the history of medicine.<br>

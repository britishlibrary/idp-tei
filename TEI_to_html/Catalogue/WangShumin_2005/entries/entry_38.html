              The extremities of the scroll are defective. It has a text on each side. On the front is Tangshi ji 唐詩集(The Anthology of Tang Poetry); this text is on the reverse. The prohibition on the name character世 (shi) of the Tang emperor Tai Zong 太宗 is observed, but the substitution of 療for the character治 (zhi), prohibited under the emperor Gao Zong 高宗 , occurs only sporadically, suggesting that the MS was written at or after the end of the Tang period, when that prohibition was no longer scrupulously adhered to.<br>
              The volume contains, in fragmentary form, remedies for deficiency and excess of marrow (sui xu-shi髓虛實), tianxing天行 (epidemic deiseases), chi yan赤眼 (red eye, normally associated with conjunctivitis) and shu lou chuang 鼠瘻瘡 (a kind of fistula).<br>

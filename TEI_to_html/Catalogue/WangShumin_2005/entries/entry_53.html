              The beginning, end and most of the second half of this MS are lost. It is 21 cm. high and 18.5 cm. long. The title and the compiler’s name are unknown. 14 columns of text remain. It contains six prescriptions, mostly from the bigu tradition, including instructions for speedy walking and for strengthening the will. We have therefore designated this work Bigu zhufang, II. The character葉 (ye) is here written C, according to the prohibition of the Tang emperor Taizong, (Li Shimin 李世民), indicating that the MS belongs to the Tang period.<br>

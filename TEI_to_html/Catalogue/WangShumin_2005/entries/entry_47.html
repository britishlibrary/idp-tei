              The scroll is 17 metres in length, and has texts on both sides. On the front is prefatory material to Biqiu han zhujie ben 比丘含注戒本 (Bhiksu’s Book of Precepts with Commentary); on the back is a section of Dazhi du lun大智度論(Treatise on Salvation through Great Wisdom), followed by Bencao jing jizhu. 721 columns of this work survive. The title and headings are missing from the beginning. However, a note at the end of the scroll reads: ‘Bencao jizhu diyi xulu — Huayang Tao yinju zhuan 本草集注第一序錄——華陽陶隱居撰’ (This is the preface to Collected Commentaries on the Pharmacopoeia, composed by the hermit Tao of Huayang). This accords with the title Tao Hongjing ‘Bencao jing jizhu’, qi juan陶弘景本草經集注七卷’ (Collected Commentaries on the Pharmaceutical Canon, seven volumes , by Tao Hongjing) in the Liang period text Qi lu 七錄, quoted in the bibliographical treatise of the History of the Sui Dynasty (Suishu: Jingji zhi 隋書·經籍志. Thus it seems clear that this is the first volume of Tao Hongjing’s annotated edition. The text is currently designated as Bencao jing jizhu, Text A (jia ben 甲本). On the basis of Tao Hongjing’s Zhouhou baiyi fang: Zixu肘後百一方·自序 (101 Remedies to Keep up your Sleeve, Author’s Preface), the original work can be dated around 500 CE.<br>
              The final two columns of the MS form a 25-character colophon, stating: One juan of materia medica, written by Yuchi Lulin 尉遲盧麟 during the hours of chen shi 辰時 (7-9:00 a.m.) on the eleventh day of the ninth lunar month in the sixth year of the Kai Yuan reign period of the Tang Dynasty, i.e. 718 CE.<br>
              In the opinion of Luo Zhenyu 羅振玉, this should be accepted for dating purposes. However, the Japanese scholar, Ogawa Takuji 小川琢治, who has carried out a textual study of the MS, considers the calligraphy of the postscript to be quite unlike that of the rest of the text, which he believes to date from the Six Dynasties period (222-589 A.D.). A recent reexamination of the MS has provided textual evidence to support a date within the Southern and Northern Dynasties period. For example, the text displays the character prohibitions of the last emperor Gao Yin 高殷of the Northern Qi and of the Tang emperors Gao Zu 高祖 (Li Yuan), Tai Zong 太宗 (Li Shimin 李世民) and Gao Zong 高宗 (Li Zhi 李治). The use of the term hengshan恒山in place of the later term changshan常山in the name of an ancient pharmaceutical corroborates this dating.<br>
              Bencao jing jizhu, which originally ran to seven volumes, is an important early annotated edition of the Shen Nong bencao jing 神農本草經(Shen Nong’s Pharmaceutical Canon). It begins with prefaces (xulie序例), followed by the main pharmacological text, recording 365 medicines from Shen Nong bencao jing and Mingyi bielu名醫別錄 (Additional Records of Famous Physicians). This work inaugurated the sevenfold classifications of medicinal substances: yushi 玉石 (jade and minerals/stones), caomu草木 (grasses and woods), chongshou蟲獸, (insects and animals), guo果(fruits), cai菜 (vegetable), migu米谷 (grain), you ming wei yong有名未用 (attested but not utilised). It provided considerable supplementary material on the cultivation and harvesting of medicinal substances and on their therapeutic uses. Although the original text has not been transmitted, there are sections in Jingshi zhenglei beiji bencao 經史證類備急本草(An Emergency Pharmacopoeia Arranged in Categories from the Canons and Histories). The copy held at the University of Ryūkoku contains only the ‘Prefaces’ section from the beginning, including Tao Hongjing’s foreword, the original preface to the work and Tao’s notes. It is concerned mainly with three grades of medicines, and their preparation, gathering, dosage and uses in various disorders. It does not touch upon medicinal wines and decoctions (tan jiu yaowu 湯酒藥物) or the seven qualities of medicinal drugs etc.<br>
              N.B. In Dunhuang yiyao wenxian jijiao, this MS is classified as Text A (jia ben甲本) to distinguish it from another fragmentary MS of Tao Hongjing’s Bencao jing jizhu (Text B, yi ben乙本), discovered at Tufan in Xinjiang. Because of its provenance, the latter MS is not discussed here.<br>

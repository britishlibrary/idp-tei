            素問·三部九候論<br>
            <span class="bibit">Suwen: Sanbu jiuhou lun</span><br>
            <span class="bibit">Basic Questions: Treatise on the Three Sectors and Nine Positions</span><br>
            
              The MS is 28.5 cm. in height. There is a portion missing. It has ruled columns and a border at the top and bottom. The beginning of each section is marked in red ink with a circle or diagonal stroke. Altogether 149 columns of text are preserved, containing copies of five books, written continuously. In order, they are: Sanbu jiuhou lun; Shanghan lun 傷寒論 (Treatise on Cold Damage), Text B (yi ben乙本); Wangmingshi maijing, I亡名氏脈經第一種 (Canon of the Pulse of Unknown Authorship, I); Shanghan lun, Text C (bing ben丙本); and Wangmingshi maijing, II 亡名氏脈經第二種. This text, the first in the sequence, occupies columns 1-31. Although the concluding portion is preserved intact, the opening is damaged and the title is consequently missing. However, a comparison with the annotated edition of Huangdi neijing suwen 黃帝內經素問 (Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor, Basic Questions) by the Tang scholar Wang Bing 王冰 reveals close textual similarities with substantial portions of the section entitled Sanbu jiuhou lun, 20 三部九候論第二十. We have therefore adopted that section heading as the title of this text.<br>
              The name of the original author is unknown, although the text was very early on incorporated into Huangdi neijing suwen 黃帝內經素問. The Sui editor, Quan Yuanqi 全元起 included it in Volume 1 under the title Jue sisheng pian 決死生篇 (Chapter on the determination of birth and death) (according to notes on Suwen 素問 by Lin Yi 林億 and others — Quan Yuanqi’s own edition has not survived). The Tang editor Wang Bing, however, included it in Volume 6 of his edition as Sanbu jiuhou lun, 20 三部九候論第二十. Yang Shangshan 楊上善, who was also active in the Sui-Tang period, placed it in the first section of Volume 14 of his annotated edition of Huangdi neijing taisu 黃帝內經太素 (the section title has not been transmitted). In the Wei-Jin period, Huangfu Mi皇甫謐 included it in Volume 4 of Zhenjiu jia yi jing 針灸甲乙經(The AB Canon of Acupuncture) under the heading Sanbu jiuhou, 3三部九候第三(The Three Sectors and Nine Positions, no 3).<br>
              On the evidence of character prohibitions, the MS can be dated to the reign of the Tang emperor Gao Zong 高宗 (650-683 CE). The character 順 (shun) in the personal name (Xiao Shun 蕭順) of the Liang emperor Wudi 武帝 is not subject to prohibition, neither is the character 旦 (dan) in the personal name (Li Dan 李旦) of the Tang emperor Rui Zong 睿宗. As in the texts of Shanghan lun (Text B) and Wangmingshi maijing, II, which are found in the same scroll, the name characters of the Tang emperor Gao Zu 高祖 (Li Yuan 李淵) are not subject to prohibition. However, prohibitions can be seen to apply to the name characters of the Tang emperor Tai Zong 太宗 (Li Shimin李世民), i.e. the character 世 (shi) is written with one stroke missing and the character葉 (ye) is replaced by XCVB; and also to the name characters of the Tang Emperor Gao Zong 高宗 (Li Zhi 李治), i.e. the character 治 (zhi) is written with one stroke missing.<br>
              The surviving portions of the text deal mainly with the nine divisions of the heavens (ye 野) and the nine viscera; the complementarity of xing 形 (presenting symptoms) and the pulses; diagnosis according to the nine positions, and the signs of death; diagnosis according to the ankle, with the three sectors and nine positions.<br>

            輔行訣臟腑用藥法要<br>
            <span class="bibit">Fuxing jue zang fu yong yaofa yao</span><br>
            <span class="bibit">Secret Instructions for Assisting the Body: Essential Methods for the Application of Drugs to the Viscera and Bowels</span><br>
            
              The MS was formerly part of the collection of Zhang Guangrong 張光榮 (styled Wonan 偓南), a doctor of Chinese medicine of Wei County 威縣, Hebei Province. Dr Zhang had obtained it from the Thousand Buddha Cave at Dunhuang shortly after the foundation of the Chinese Republic (1912) by means of a sizable payment to the resident Daoist priest. On his death, Dr Zhang bequeathed the scroll to his grandson Zhang Dachang 張大昌, styled Jing 靖, also a doctor of Chinese medicine. Dr Zhang Dachang used it as a teaching text and had three copies made. Sadly, the original was destroyed in 1966 in the course of the Cultural Revolution, although all three copies escaped unscathed. In 1974, Dr Zhang Dachang presented a copy to the Chinese Medicine Research Institute of China, under the name ‘the barefoot doctor’.<br>
              Ma Jixing 馬繼興, research fellow of the Institute and Professor Zhang Zhenglang 張政烺and Professor Li Xueqin 李學勤of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have published appraisals of the text. Ma Jixing writes: ‘This is not a modern or contemporary imitation, thus its date of composition is certainly not later than the beginning of the Northern Song period. It merits serious attention.’ Professors Zhang Zhenglang and Li Xueqin state: ‘This is not a modern counterfeit, but neither can it date back as far as the Liang period. It is a copy of an ancient text, and as such it must be preserved.'<br>
              At Ma Jixing’s request, a group of scholars including Wang Xuetai 王雪苔, Wang Shumin 王淑民and Tao Guangzheng 陶廣正made two field trips to Wei County to carry out further research and interview Dr Wang Dachang. During their second visit in particular, they kept very detailed records, including audiotapes; and on that occasion, they were able to see the other two copies of Dr Wang’s legacy, which was of great assistance in establishing the original text.<br>
              The text of the copy is virtually intact. It consists of one volume, bearing the title Fuxingjue zangfu yongyao fayao輔行訣臟腑用藥法要(Secret Instructions for Assisting the Body: Essential Methods for the Application of Drugs to the Viscera and Bowels). The section headings and the wording of the text are without parallel in the extant compendia, monographs and catalogues. It bears the superscription Liang Huayang yinju Tao Hongjing zhuan ‘梁華陽隱居陶弘景撰’ (composed in the Liang period by Tao Hongjing, the hermit of Huayang). However, the words ‘Thus spoke Tao/the hermit Tao/Hongjing’ recur throughout the text, indicating that it was compiled from recollections of the master’s lectures by a disciple or other recipient of the oral tradition. The text contains annotations and other evidence of subsequent editorial intervention. However the absence of Northern Song character prohibition phenomena, such as the substitution of玄武for真武 (zhen wu), shows that any revisions cannot be later than the Northern Song period.<br>
              The book draws mainly on three sections of Tangye jingfa 湯液經法(Canonical Methods for Brews and Decoctions), a classic book of remedies of the Han period: 1) Rules of reinforcing and reducing methods for the five viscera (wuzang buxie fa li五臟補瀉法例). This section contains a theoretical discussion of the treatment of symptoms of excess and deficiency of the five viscera. It includes 34 remedies. 2) This section deals with the five phases in relation to medicinal substances and the production and transformation of the five flavours.It sets out the signs of the way the five phases contain each other, and the application of the transformations of the five flavours, and reveals the rules governing the use of medicinal substances in canonical prescriptions. 3) This section presents sixteen remedies for infectious diseases (tianxing 天行) and traces the origins of their formulation. It is thought to be the earliest Chinese collection of remedies for infectious diseases.<br>
              In all the book contains 56 remedies. Most of these also appeared in Shanghan lun 傷寒論 (Treatise on Cold Damage) by the Eastern Han master Zhang Zhongjing 張仲景. Through the extant versions of Shanghan lun and Jinkui yaolüe fang lun 金匱要略方論(Treatise on the Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Casket), they have been handed down in a continuous line of transmission to the present day.<br>

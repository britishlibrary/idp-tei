            <span class="bibit">The seven superficial and eight deep pulses in the three sectors</span><br>
            
              For a description of P. 3655, please see Abstract 12. The MS contains copies of three books in 79 columns of text. This text, the second in the sequence, runs from column 44 to column 64. The original title is lost; Qibiao bali sanbu mai has been adopted as a collective heading for the three sections of this piece.<br>
              Qibiao bali sanbu mai is not mentioned in the ancient medical classics or catalogues. The text falls into three sections: 1) Qibiao七表 (the seven externals) deals with seven types of pulse indicative of external disorder; 2) Bali八裏 (the eight internals) deals with eight types of pulse related to internal disorder; 3) San bu mai三部脈discusses the five types of pulse observable in each of the three sectors (cun寸, guan關and chi尺) of the wrist. The entire text is written in heptasyllabic metre. It is broadly similar to the extant copies of Wang Shuhe’s Maijue 王叔和脈訣 (Secret Instructions on the Pulse), except that it lacks certain sections, such as Jiu dao mai九道脈, which suggests that it belongs to an early manuscript tradition. On the grounds summarised under no 12 above, it can be dated to the early Tang period.<br>

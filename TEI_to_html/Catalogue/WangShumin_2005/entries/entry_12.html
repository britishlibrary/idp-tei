              The MS is concertina bound (jingzhe zhuang 經折裝). It is 28.8 cm. in height and has eight folds and eighteen pages with 79 columns of text. It is virtually intact. It contains copies of three books, written continuously on the front and back of the page. In order, they are Mingtang wuzang lun 明堂五臟論, Qibiao bali sanbu mai 七表八裏三部脈(The Seven Superficial and Eight Deep Pulses in the Three Sectors) and Qing Wu Zi maijue青烏子脈訣 (Master Qing Wu’s Secret Instructions on the Pulse). This text, the first in the MS, runs from column 1 to column 44. The title given here appears in the original.<br>
              Mingtang wuzang lun is not mentioned in the ancient medical classics or catalogues. The work quotes from the lost text Yukui zhenjing玉匱針經 (Jade Casket Needle Canon) by Lü Guang 呂廣who lived in the Wu state during the Three Kingdoms period. This suggests that it was composed during the Six Dynasties period. The MS must, however, date from the beginning of the Tang period, since the name characters of the Tang emperor Tai Zong 太宗 (Li Shimin李世民) are subject to prohibition, (葉[ye] is written VBC) but not those of the Tang emperor Gao Zong 高宗 (Li Zhi李治) (the character治 [zhi] is used freely).<br>
              The text is preserved in its entirety, except for a few chapter headings, which are effaced. It consists of a general introduction followed by five chapters, dealing separately with each of the five viscera. It discusses the manifestations of the internal organs.<br>

              The scroll is 27 cm. long. The top and bottom are defective. It has a text on each side. On the front is Tangren xuanfang 唐人選方 (Selected remedies from Tang authors), Vol. 1 (q.v.); this text is on the reverse. To judge from the script, the two texts were not copied by the same hand; moreover, the first but not the second contains new characters introduced in the Wu-Zhou period. Of this book of prescriptions, 111 columns are preserved but the title, headings and author’s name have not survived. It is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, XVI.<br>
              The character葉 (ye), prohibited under the Tang emperor Tai Zong 太宗 (Li Shimin 李世民), is written as C, but the character prohibitions of the emperor Gao Zong 高宗 are not evidenced, indicating that the MS was written at the beginning of the Tang period.<br>
              The text contains 62 miscellaneous medicinal remedies and moxibustion treatments for conditions including peripartum disorders, huang bing黃病, tianxing rebing天行熱病 (epidemic heat diseases), diseases of the throat, vomiting, pulmonary diseases and rubella (fengzhen 風).<br>

              The scroll is 27 cm. in height and contains 69 columns of text. The top is largely intact but portions are missing at the bottom. The text is not mentioned in the ancient medical classics or catalogues. According to Luo Fuyi 羅福頤, there is an entry in Jiu Tang zhi 舊唐志Jiu Tang shu: Jing ji zhi: Jishu 舊唐書·經籍志·技術 (the ‘Techniques and arts’ section of the bibliographical treatise of the Old History of the Tang) on ‘Xuan Gan zhuan shi fang. One volume.’ (玄感傳屍方一卷), which gives the author as Su You. Luo Fuyi notes that, since Xuan Gan was a name adopted by Su You, it is probable that Maijing is by the same writer.<br>
              Xin Tang shu: Yiwen zhi 新唐書·藝文志 (the bibliographical treatise of the New History of the Tang) contains the entry: ‘Tai yi tie yin shen dan fang, three volumes, by Su You.’ (太一鐵胤神丹方三卷，蘇遊撰). Jiu Tang shu: Jing ji zhi 舊唐書·經籍志 (the bibliographical treatise of the Old History of the Tang) has ‘Su You, Tiefen lun, one volume.’ (蘇遊鐵粉論一卷). Ishinpō 醫心方(Prescriptions at the Heart of Medicine), Vol. 10, Shuipi bing水癖病, and Vol. 25, Xiao’er bing 小兒病 (paediatric disorders), each cite two passages from lost texts by Xuan Gan. The Northern Song catalogue Mishu sheng xu bian dao si ku que shumu秘書省續編到四庫闕書目 has under Daoist texts (Dao shu lei道書類): ‘Shen danfang, one volume, by Xuan Gan. Missing.’ (蘇遊撰神丹方一卷，缺). Songshi: Yiwen zhi 宋史·藝文志(The bibliographical treatise of The History of the Song) has in the classification Physicians ( Yi jia lei醫家類): ‘Su You, Tie fen lun, one volume; Xuan Gan zhuanshi fang, one volume ‘ (蘇遊鐵粉論一卷、玄感傳屍方一卷)’ A further entry states ‘Su Chan (original note: scilicet You), Xuan Gan lun, one volume (蘇巉（原注：一作遊）玄感論一卷). All this corroborates the identification of Xuan Gan with the physician Su You and the attribution to him of Xuan Gan maijing.<br>
              The text does not exhibit the Tang prohibition on the character 治 (zhi), which indicates that it was composed at the beginning of the Tang period or earlier. There are two instances of the character旦(dan) which are significant for the date of copying: the first is written ASH with one stroke missing, while the second is realised as a sequence of 口 plus 一. The latter is clearly a copyist’s error, attributable to unfamiliarity with the character prohibitions of the Tang emperor Rui Zong 睿宗, which suggests that the MS was written in the Five Dynasties period.<br>
              The MS contains two section headings: Nian mai zhixia qing zhong mai minglei xingzhuang, 2撚脈指下輕重脈名類形狀第二and Yinyang ni chengfu, 3陰陽逆乘伏第三 (The contrary ascendance and prostration of Yin and Yang, 3). Of the three sections of the treatise represented here, the text but not the title of the first piece survives, and the title but not the text of the third, i.e. the first two sections are all that remains of the entire treatise. The first section is mainly concerned with the locations for pulse diagnosis, the three sectors and nine positions, the seven diagnoses, and diagnosis on the basis of the cunkou 寸口wrist pulse. The second section examines 23 abnormal pulse phenomena, including fast and slow pulses, light and heavy pulses, aspects of the relation to respiratory rate, strong, floating and smooth pulses; as well as six fatal pulse phenomena including wulou 屋漏 (leaky house) and quezhuo 雀啄 (sparrow peck). This account of the methodology of the three sectors and nine positions, uniquely refers to a medical theory that ‘consciousness’ resides at the toujiao頭角 (corners of the head).<br>

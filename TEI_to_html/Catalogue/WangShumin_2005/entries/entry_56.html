              This MS belongs to the collection of Luo Zhenyu 羅振玉 and the text has been published in Zhen song tang cang xi chui mi ji cong can貞松堂藏西陲秘笈叢殘, by Luo Zhenyu, and Xi chui fangji shu canjuan hui bian西陲方技書殘卷彙編(Compilation of fragmentary scrolls on remedies and techniques from the Dunhuang area), by Luo Fuyi羅福頤.<br>
              The beginning and end of the MS are defective. The title and author’s name are missing; it has been given the descriptive title Liaofu shifang. The MS contains 96 columns of text including 36 independent entries on various diseases and their treatment. The twentieth entry is succeeded by the original heading of the seventh section, i.e. Jieshi fang di 7 ‘解石方第七’ (Prescription for releasing stones no 7). From this it can be seen that the first twenty entries form the end of the sixth section; however the name of that section cannot be inferred. Of the seventh section only sixteen entries remain. The MS can be tentatively dated to the mid Tang period.<br>

            王宗無忌單方<br>
            <span class="bibit">Wang Zong, Wuji danfang</span><br>
            <span class="bibit">Wang Zong’s Single Ingredient Remedies without Prohibition</span><br>
            
              This work is not mentioned in the ancient medical texts or other sources. We may surmise that Wang Zong was the author, since this is stated in the heading of the MS; however, there are no historical records to support this attribution.<br>
              The character following Zong in the heading (here transcribed wu) has been identified as奇 (ji), which is glossed as yinshi qi ni bu de xi ‘飲食氣逆，不得息’ (retrograde circulation of vital energy after eating and drinking, shortness of breath). However, according to a note in Shuowen: Wang bu說文·亡部, it is a variant form of 無 (wu), meaning without. In fact, it very much resembles the current simplified form of that character -- 无. We therefore render the title of this work as Wuji danfang 無忌單方, signifying that nothing is censored in the prescriptions contained therein. So far as it is possible to ascertain, given the fragmentary state of the MS, the text dealt with various taboo subjects.<br>
              The first column of the MS reads: ‘Jiushi chu ju ti ru hou九十處具題如後’, indicating that the text originally contained 90 prescriptions, although only eight have survived. These consist mostly of remedies for gynaecological and paediatric disorders. Because much of the text is missing or illegible, the prescriptions are largely unintelligible.<br>

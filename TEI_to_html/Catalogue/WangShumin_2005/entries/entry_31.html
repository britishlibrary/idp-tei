              This is a fragmentary butterfly bound (hudie zhuang蝴蝶裝) volume, with 15 half-pages of 12-13 columns each and 8 folds. The beginning and end are defective and the title, headings and author’s name are absent. It is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, X.<br>
              In view of the distinctive type of binding, Luo Fuyi believed this MS to date from the Five Dynasties or early Song period. On the internal evidence of the prohibited character世 (shi), it is now considered to be the work of a Tang copyist; however the date of composition is uncertain.<br>
              This collection consists mainly of remedies for disorders of the head and five sensory organs and complications of childbirth.<br>

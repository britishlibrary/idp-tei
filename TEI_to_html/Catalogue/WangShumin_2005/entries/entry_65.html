            <span class="bibit">The ten fatal maladies from the Sutra of Succouring All Living Beings in Adversity</span><br>
            
              Jiu zhu zhong sheng ku nan jing is a Buddhist text exhorting the faithful to rid themselves of evil and follow virtue.<br>
              It names ten apparently contagious diseases which were prevalent at the time of writing, viz. nüebing 瘧病 (intermittent fever), tianxing天行 (a generic term for epidemic diseases), zubing 卒病 (fatal diseases), zhongbing 腫病 (inflammatory diseases), chanbing産病 (diseases of childbirth) huanfu患腹(suffering in the abdomen), huanyong 患癰 (suffering from boils), fenghuangbing 風黃病 (wind yellow disease, normally associated with jaundice), shuili 水痢 (water diarrhoea), yanbing 眼病 (diseases of the eye).<br>
              Nineteen other editions of the Jiu zhu zhong sheng (yiqie) kunan jing 救諸衆生（一切）苦難經 (Sutra of succouring all living beings in [every] adversity) were discovered in the manuscript Cave at Dunhuang. Also various versions of the Xin Pusa jing 新菩薩經 (New Bodhisattva sutra) mention thirty, but in all cases these include the ten diseases named here. A latest date for this MS can be set at 803 CE (19th year of the Zhenyuan reign period). For a discussion of this dating, see Fujieda Akira 藤枝晃 in Bokubi 墨美, no 97, 1960.<br>

              For a description of P. 3655, please see Abstract 12. The MS contains copies of three books in 79 columns of text. This text, the third in the sequence, runs from column 64 to column 79.<br>
              Qing Wu Zi maijue is not mentioned in the ancient medical classics or catalogues. Qing Wu Zi (Master Blue Crow) is a soubriquet. However, Jiu Tang shu: Jing jizhi 舊唐書·經籍志(the bibliographical treatise of the Old History of the Tang) lists under the Wuxing lei五行類 (Category of the Five Phases) three volumes of Qing Wu Zi and various series of Zang jing 葬經(funerary classics) in eight, ten and two volumes, all by the author Xiao Ji 蕭吉. It appears then that Master Qing Wu is to be identified with Xiao Ji.<br>
              Xiao Ji was active around the end of the sixth century CE, in the Six Dynasties period. His life is documented both in Beishi北史, Vol. 89 and in Suishu隋書(History of the Sui Dynasty), Vol. 78. He was the grandson of Xiaoyi蕭懿, King of Changsha, and the elder brother of the Wudi 梁武 emperor of the Liang period. An expert on Yin and Yang divination, he edited a compendium of Yin and Yang studies from the earliest times to the Sui period. His published writing included the thirty volume work Jin hai 金海 (Sea of Gold), the eight volume Zhai jing 宅經 (Canon of the Siting of Dwellings), the twenty volume Yue pu 樂譜 (Musical Scores?) and the two volume Diwang yangsheng fang 帝王養生方 (Prescriptions of the Divine Kings for Physical Cultivation). In the book catalogue Mishu sheng xu bian dao si ku que shumu 秘書省續編到四庫闕書目, there is an entry under Wuxing bushi lei 五行蔔筮類 which reads: ‘Zhai gu ji by Master Qing Wu, one volume. Missing.’ (青烏子撰宅骨記一卷。缺).<br>
              This apparently refers to Zhai jing or a similar work. Songshi: Yiwen zhi 宋史·藝文志(the bibliographical treatise of The History of the Song) lists ‘Qing Wu Zi lun. One volume.’ (青烏子論一卷) and ‘Qing Wu Zi feng jing . One volume.’ (青烏子風經一卷) in the category of Medical Books (Yi shu lei醫書類); and the verse work ‘Qing Wu Zi gejue (two volumes).’(青烏子歌訣二卷) in the category of the Five Phases (Wuxing lei五行類). These are presumably also works by Xiao Ji.<br>
              The work can be dated before the Sui period by the occurrence in the MS of the graph飰for飯 (fan). According to the Qing period scholar Wang Yun王筠 (See Shuo wen ju du 說文句讀), the character 飯 (fan) was taboo in the Six Dynasties period and was accordingly replaced by 飰. There seems to be a textual relation between Qing Wu Zi maijue and the Zuoyou shou zhenmai ge左右手診脈歌 in the extant versions of Wang Shuhe’s Maijue 王叔和脈訣(Secret Instructions on the Pulse), and it may in fact be an early variant of the latter.<br>
              The text includes seven verses, all in heptasyllabic metre (qiyan gejue七言歌訣). The first is an overview of pulse diagnostics, while the following verses deal in turn with the pulses in the cun寸, guan關and chi尺positions of the left and right wrists.<br>

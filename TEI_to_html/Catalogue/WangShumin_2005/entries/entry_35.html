              The top and bottom of the MS are defective. It consists of one small irregular fragment, 11 cm. high and 16 cm. long, with ruled lines. Nine columns of text survive. The title, headings and author’s name are not preserved. It is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, XV.<br>
              The date of composition is unknown but the type of script and style of calligraphy suggest that the MS dates from the Tang period.<br>
              The text is the table of contents from a book of medical prescriptions. Judging from this, the book must have contained at least 63 sections, but only a dozen or so prescriptions can now be identified by name.<br>

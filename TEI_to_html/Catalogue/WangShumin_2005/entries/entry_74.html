              This is a compilation of biographical material on historical figures of the pre-Han period, arranged by category. According to Xiang Da 向達, it is probably a version of the Soushen ji 搜神記 (Records of an Inquest into the Spirit-Realm). But since below the item on Zuo Ci 左慈 in the ‘Magical Arts’ section it cites the source ‘Gan Bao, of the Jin dynasty, Soushen ji’, it is clearly not itself the Soushen ji. Here we term it Anonymous Encyclopaedia. The section entitled Yibu 醫卜 contains the biographies of seven personages including Dong Quan 董拳 and Guo Yu 郭玉.<br>

              The beginning of the text is defective as a portion of the scroll is missing. There is a text on each side. On the front is a fragment of the Xiao jing 孝經; this book of prescriptions is on the reverse. There are ten columns of legible text containing nine prescriptions. The title, headings and author’s name are missing, and it is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, V.<br>
              The characters 治 (zhi) and 療 (liao) are used interchangeably indicating that the MS was written after the Tang period, although the text was probably composed earlier.<br>
              This volume includes treatments for external injuries, gynaecological and obstetric disorders, xintong心痛 (cardiac and other thoracic pain), chili 赤痢and baili白痢.<br>

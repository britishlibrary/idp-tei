              The scroll has a text on each side. On the front is a Daoist scripture; this text is on the reverse. The top of the scroll has portions missing but the lower part is intact. There is a border at the top and bottom and at the end, but no ruled lines. Altogether 89 columns of text survive. Each remedy is one or two columns long and starts on a fresh line. Nearly all are preceded by a red dot and/or outlined in red. The title, headings and author's name are missing.<br>
              All the remedies in this text involve a one-to-one relationship between a disease and a single ingredient (only rarely dual ingredients) or a single moxibustion point, as is implied by the expression danfang單方 (single [ingredient] remedy) which appears in l. 50, and which has been adopted as the title of the book. There are no compound remedies.<br>
              The character葉 (ye) is subject to prohibition, indicating that the MS dates from the Tang period.<br>
              Altogether it has been possible to decipher 85 remedies for various internal and external conditions, including gynaecological and paediatric disorders.<br>

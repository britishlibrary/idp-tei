              The beginning and end and lower half of the fragment are incomplete. It bears traces of ruled lines. Only the upper half of nine columns of text is preserved. The title, headings and author’s name have not survived. It is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, XXXVII. Since the character治 (zhi) is not subject to prohibition in the MS, it must have been written before the Tang period.<br>

              The extremities of the scroll are incomplete. The title, headings and compiler’s name are missing. The MS consists of two fragments, containing 13 columns of 30-35 characters each. The text is written entirely in black; save for a red circle preceding the name of each medicine, no red ink is used. Eight medicines remain, viz. Chinese green onion seed (cong shizi蔥實子) (including the root and juice) bitter gourd苦瓠 (ku gua), wood betony (shui su水蘇), purple perilla (zi su紫蘇), liaoshi蓼實— a fruit of the Polygonum family (including the leaves and also the variant known as maliao馬蓼), perilla (renzi荏子) (including the leaves), honeysuckle (muxu苜蓿) and mustard (jie芥), all pharmaceuticals of the vegetable order. It is clear from a comparison with citations in transmitted works that these come from the section on vegetable medicines in Xinxiu bencao, juan 8. This MS is now classified as Xinxiu bencao, Text C (bing ben丙本).<br>
              In view of the fact that the characters治 (zhi) and世 (shi) are subject to prohibition in the MS, it is presumably the work of a Tang copyist.<br>

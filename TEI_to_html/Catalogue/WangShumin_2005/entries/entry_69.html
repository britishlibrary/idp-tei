              The beginning of the scroll is defective, but the end is intact. The text is the first volume of Si fen lü shan fan bu que xing shi chao四分律刪繁補缺行事鈔 (Condensed and supplemented transcript of topics in the Vinaya in four sections) . It bears the subheading Liang chu zhong qing wu yi ‘量處重輕物儀’ (Method for the allocation of ‘heavy and light’ objects’) and concludes with the words ‘Shamen sejia Dao xuan shu沙門釋迦道宣述’ (Described by the monk Dao Xuan (596 – 667 CE)) and a note that the MS was written in the third year of the Long Shuo 龍朔reign period, i.e. 663 CE. The three passages concerning the ‘requisites for curing disorders’ (zhi bing suo xu治病所須) are valuable source material for the history of medicine, and are therefore included here.<br>

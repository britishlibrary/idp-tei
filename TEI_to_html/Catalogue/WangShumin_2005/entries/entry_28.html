              The top and bottom of the scroll are defective. There is a text on each side. On the front is a fragmentary Daoist scripture; this book of prescriptions is on the reverse. Thirty-three columns of text survive in a fragmentary state. The title, headings and author’s name are missing, and it is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, VII.<br>
              The characters療 (liao) and治 (zhi) are used interchangeably and no other character prohibitions of the Tang emperors are apparent, providing evidence that the MS was written after the Tang era. However, the date of composition cannot be established precisely.<br>
              The MS contains 13 prescriptions including remedies for 眼赤yan chi (redness of the eye, associated with conjunctivitis), tianxing天行 (a generic term for epidemic diseases), constipation and dysuria as well as niuyi 牛疫 (cattle plague).<br>

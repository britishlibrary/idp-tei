            唐人選方<br>
            <span class="bibit">Tangren xuanfang</span><br>
            <span class="bibit">Selected remedies from Tang authors</span><br>
            
              The top and bottom of the MS are defective. The original title and the author’s name are missing and many passages are incomplete or vestigial. The three surviving segments are held in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris under three separate catalogue numbers. However, all three are identical as regards script, style and format. The text is eclectic in character, comprising a selection of remedies by pre-Tang physicians, whose names are cited in full. The three segments all contain new character forms introduced in the Wu-Zhou period (e.g. new forms of 天 [tian], 地 [di], 人 [ren], 年 [nian], 月 [yue], 日 [ri]), showing that they were written during the reign of the woman emperor Wu Zetian 武則天. The above provides evidence that the three pieces are dispersed fragments of a single MS of the same work. They have therefore been given the collective title Tangren xuanfang (zhu) 唐人選方（注） (Selected remedies from Tang authors [annotated]).<br>
              The fragments are distinguished as Text A (jia juan 甲卷 — P. 2565), Text B (yi juan乙卷 — P. 2662) and Text C (bing juan 丙 — P. 3731). Altogether there are 226 columns of text: 104 in Text A; 83 in Text; and 3 in Text C. Regarding the relationship between the three fragments: the torn end of fragment A fits together with the beginning of Text B, completing the interrupted text, so that the two texts can be reunited as a continuous scroll; but Text C cannot be placed in sequence since it does not follow on directly from either of the other two, indicating that a considerable portion of the MS is lost.<br>
              The work contains miscellaneous remedies drawn from clinical practice, without any signs of classification. Text A includes 21 remedies, Text B includes 27 remedies as well as an essay, and Text C includes eight; i.e. altogether 56 remedies are preserved.<br>
              N.B. In Dunhuang guyiji kaoshi 敦煌古醫籍考釋(Annotations on the Ancient Medical Texts from the Dunhuang Cave Library), this work is identified as Tangren xuanfang di 1 zhong 唐人選方第一種(Selected remedies from Tang authors, I), to distinguish it from Selected remedies from Tang authors, II, another collection of remedies compiled by an unknown master, which was discovered at Turfan in Xinjiang. The latter is not transcribed here as it does not form part of the Dunhuang corpus.<br>

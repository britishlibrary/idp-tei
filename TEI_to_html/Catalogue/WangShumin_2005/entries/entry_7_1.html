            <span class="bibit">Treatise on the Five Viscera, Text A</span><br>
            
              The text is headed ‘Zhang Zhongjing xuan張仲景撰’ (compiled by Zhang Zhongjing). However, the work contains numerous references to the post-Han medical literature, e.g. Hua Tuo華佗 (Later Han period), Ge Hong葛洪and Liu Juanzi 劉涓子 (Jin period), Song Xia宋俠 (Northern Qi period), Tao Hongjing陶弘景(Liang period), Yao Sengyuan’s Ji yanfang姚僧垣集驗方and Lei Gong’s Paozhi lun雷公炮炙論 (Song?). The attribution must therefore be spurious;this is apparently the work of an unknown author of a much later period.<br>
              There are texts on both sides of the scroll. On the front is part of the second chapter of the Buddhist essay Qiong zha bianhuo lun 窮詐辨惑論. The reverse bears 174 columns of text, comprising copies of the two books Wuzang lun and Pingmai lüeli平脈略例(A Brief Outline of Normal Pulses) Text B (yi ben 乙本), written continuously. This text, i.e. the former, occupies columns 1-108. The title Wuzang lun appears at the beginning of the MS.<br>
              We find Zhang Zhongjing’s Wuzang lun first mentioned in the Song period, in texts including Chongwen zongmu 崇文總目, edited by Wang Yaochen 王堯臣et al.; Zheng Qiao’s 鄭樵 Tong zhi: Yiwen lüe 通志·藝文略; and Songshi: Yiwen zhi 宋史·藝文志(The bibliographical treatise of The History of the Song). The book apparently ceased to circulate or to be copied after the Song period, and is little cited in the extant medical classics. Four exemplars were preserved in the Stone Chamber at Dunhuang, and they are here distinguished as Texts A, B, C and D (jia甲, yi乙, ding丁). The present text, Text A (jia ben甲本), is the most extensive of the four. Although the MS is intact from beginning to end, the text is somewhat corrupt. Fragments of this book also appear in two other locations:<p>1. Yifang lei ju (Collected and Classified Medical Remedies), Volume 4, Wuzang men (Study of the Five Viscera) 醫方類聚卷四’五臟門, which reproduces lost portions of text from Wuzang lun五臟論.</p>2. An anonymous text, headed Jin: Zhang Yuansu xu 金·張元素序 (Jin Dynasty: Preface by Zhang Yuansu), which appeared as the preface to a woodblock printed book once in general circulation (the publication date is unknown). Though there are no physical remains of the printed edition, the text survives in a handwritten copy made by a celebrated physician of Zhejiang, Zhang Yicheng 張藝成, in the Qing period.<br>
              The MS exhibits prohibitions on the name characters世 (shi) and葉 (ye) of the Tang emperor Tai Zong 太宗 and the name character 治 (zhi) of the Tang emperor Gao Zong 高宗 (replaced by療), and also the character弘 (hong) in the name of Gao Zong’s son, Li Hong 李弘 (this last is simply omitted). On the other hand, no prohibition applies to the characters in the name Li Xian 李顯, another personal name of the emperor Gao Zong, or to the name characters of the Tang emperors Rui Zong 睿宗 (Li Dan李旦) and Mu Zong 穆宗 (Li Heng李恒). The MS must therefore have been written in the seventh century, at the beginning of the Tang period.<br>
              The text deals principally with the functions of the five viscera, etiology, diagnostic methodology and the virtues and applications of commonly used medicinal substances.<br>

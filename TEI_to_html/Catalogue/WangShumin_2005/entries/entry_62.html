              The beginning and end of this scroll are damaged. It contains 38 columns of text, the first 24 columns of which are taken from Buddhist scripture. The remainder, from l. 25 onward, is a prescription for a Buddhist remedy, viz. a complete set of instructions for the preparation of magical pills for fortifying the heart. The precise date of composition and copying are unknown.<br>
              Wei Yilin 危亦林, a writer of the Yuan period, includes in his book Shiyi de xiao fang 世醫得效方 (Efficacious Prescriptions from a Hereditary Physician) a recipe for Tian Wang buxin dan 天王補心丹 (Heavenly Ruler pills for fortifying the heart) which is substantially identical to the prescription in the MS with regard to its designation, uses and formulation, with certain minor substitutions of ingredients. This demonstrates that the original recipe for Tian Wang bu xin dan was already in existence by the Late Tang or Five Dynasties period.<br>

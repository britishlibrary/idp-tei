              The bottom of this scroll is fragmentary. The title and the author’s name are unknown. The first 69 columns record various prescriptions for a bigu regime. The rest of the MS, from column 70 onward is taken up by the opening section of the scripture San fang hua tong genben shenmi zhi yin bing fa 三方化同根本神秘之印並法 (Original mystical seal of the three areas combined, plus method), the end of which is missing. Bigu zhu di 4 zhong 辟谷諸方第四種 (Bigu prescriptions IV) designates the former section. The characters世 (shi) and 旦 (dan) are subject to prohibition in the MS, but not the character恒 (heng), enabling it to be dated to the middle of the Tang Dynasty.<br>
              The prescriptions and techniques described here include Fuling bing fa 茯苓餅法 (Fuling cake method), Fu huma fa 服胡麻法 (Flax method), Fu huaizi fa服槐子法 (Scholar tree seed method), Qu sanshi fang去三屍方 (Prescription for removing the ‘three corpses’), Fu huangjing fang 服黃精方 (Polygonum prescription), Fu dadou fang服大豆方 (Soybean prescription), Fu mazi fang服麻子方 (Sesame or hemp seed prescription) and Fu wuzhi fang服五芝方 (Wuzhi prescription).<br>

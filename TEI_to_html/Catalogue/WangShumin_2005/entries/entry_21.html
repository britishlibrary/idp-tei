              There are texts on both sides of the scroll. On the front is a heptasyllabic verse composition called Gu xian ji 古賢集; this text is on the reverse. It consists of twenty-seven lines, of which the lower part only is preserved, as the top of the MS is mostly missing or damaged. The book title Heidi yaolüe fang , which has been adopted here, appears at the conclusion of the text on l. 20. The succeeding columns contain six prescriptions and appear to be an appendix. Most of this section is fragmentary: although 22 separate prescriptions can be discerned, only nine are intact.<br>
              Heidi yaolüe fang is not mentioned in the early medical texts or catalogues. The author is unknown. Heidi (the Black Emperor), one of the mythic Five Heavenly Emperors of Chinese tradition, was the divinity of the North. According to Huangdi neijing: Lingshu jing (Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor: Numinous Pivot), ‘Twenty-five persons of Yin and Yang’, no 6, 14 黃帝內經·靈樞經’陰陽二十五人篇第六十四’:<p>The person is of the watery element, able to ascend to the heavens, like the Black emperor. That person is of black complexion… 水形之人，比於上羽，似于黑帝。其人黑色……</p>Given that the kidney is the watery organ and is associated with the colour black, it may be assumed that the text contained remedies for disorders of the kidneys. Those portions of the text that can be deciphered do indeed make mention of the effects of sexual excess (fangsun) and disorders of the female and male genitalia, which are classified as kidney related disorders.<br>
              The characters治 (zhi) and療 (liao) are used indifferently in this text; and the character 葉(ye) is subject to prohibition * but not the character旦 (dan). This indicates that the MS was written around the late Tang or Five Dynasties period.<br>

              For a description of P. 3287, please see Abstract 2. The scroll contains five books in 149 columns of text.This text, the third in the sequence, occupies columns 51-60. As the original title has become illegible, it has been given the descriptive title Wangmingshi maijing, I.<br>
              Since the text cites from Maijue 脈訣 (Secret instructions on the pulse), it was probably composed during the Six Dynasties period. The MS is contemporary with that of Sanbu jiuhou lun (see above), i.e. it dates from the reign of the Tang emperor Gao Zong高宗. It deals mainly with techniques for determining whether a patient is likely to live or die on the basis of the depth of the patient's breathing.<br>

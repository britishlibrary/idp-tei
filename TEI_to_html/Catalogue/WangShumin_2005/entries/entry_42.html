              The MS consists of a fragmentary sheet with text on both sides. The extremities are incomplete. There are medical prescriptions on the reverse. On the front is a copy of Zhongru san fang, accompanied by directions for dosage and administration. Unfortunately, the concluding part of this is mutilated and illegible.<br>

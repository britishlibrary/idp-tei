              On the front of the scroll is the latter part of the Buddhist essay Qiong zha bian huo lun 窮詐辨惑論. On the reverse are 174 columns of text, containing copies of two books: Zhang Zhongjing’s Wuzang lun 張仲景五臟論 (Treatise on the Five Viscera), Text A (jia ben甲); and Pingmai lüeli 平脈略 例, Text B (yi ben乙本). The latter runs from column 109 to the end. It is headed Pingmai lüeli, yi juan (Volume 1) 平脈略例一卷and is very similar in content to Text A (jia ben甲)of that work. It has therefore been designated as Text B.<br>
              The MS can be dated to the early decades of the Tang period, in the seventh century CE (see the discussion of the dating of Wuzang lun, Text A). In content, it is broadly similar to Pingmai lüeli, Text A.<br>

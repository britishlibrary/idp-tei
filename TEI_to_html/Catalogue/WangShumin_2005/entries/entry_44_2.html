              This MS shares a catalogue number with Xinji beiji jiujing, Text A. Title, headings and author’s name are missing. There is a text on each side of the scroll. On the back is the opening of a memorial signed by Cao Yijin曹議金; the front contains a text on taboos regarding the passage of the human spirit. The latter closely resembles Text A, Part II, with minor variations of wording, and is therefore currently identified as Xinji beiji jiujing, jia ben (Text B). Since Cao Yijin (d. 935 CE) lived during the Five Dynasties period (907-960 CE), the MS must have been recopied sometime before or during that period.<br>
              This MS contains only the text on taboos regarding human beings and spirits. There are no accompanying acupuncture and moxibustion charts.<br>

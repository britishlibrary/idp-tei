              The scroll is 27.8 cm. in height and 88 cm. long, and has a border at the top and bottom. There is a text on each side. On the front are chapters 3-7 of Xiao Jing 孝經. The book of remedies is on the reverse. The beginning is intact but the end is damaged and there are lacunae in the text. The title Za liaobing yaofang is taken from the heading of the scroll.<br>
              Za liaobing yaofang is not mentioned in the early catalogues of medical texts. Because the end of the scroll is fragmentary, there is no way of telling how many volumes it originally comprised. Twenty-five miscellaneous remedies survive, including prescriptions for fengchuang風瘡, chili 赤痢and baili 白痢, and susun 勞損.<br>

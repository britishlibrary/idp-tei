              There is a text on each side of the scroll. On the front is Si fen lü jie mo 四分律羯磨, Vol. 2; on the reverse is an almanac for the fourth year of the Tong Guan 同光reign period of the Later Tang Dynasty, i.e. 926 CE followed by the medical text. The original title of the treatise is missing and its date of composition is uncertain. The text contains medical texts on acupuncture and moxibustion at the beginning, which are integrated into other remedy and prescriptive literature in the almanac. Similar material is found in the Dunhuang MSS Xinji beiji jiujing, Texts A (jia ben甲本) and B (yi乙本). The title is descriptive.<br>
              The text describes the points on the human body corresponding to each of the thirty days of the lunar month.<br>

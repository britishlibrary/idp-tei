              The MS consists of an irregular fragment, 24.5 cm. high and 13.5 cm. long. Both title and compiler’s name are missing. There is a text on each side. On the front is a Daoist work; this book is found on the reverse. It consists of a fragmentary sheet bearing five columns of text, of which the first half is missing. In the light of the Xinxiu bencao 新修本草material preserved in the Ninnaji Temple in Japan and the citations from Xinxiu bencao in Zhenglei bencao證類本草(Categorised Pharmacopoeia), it can be identified as a version of the passages on the medicinal uses of plum fruit and loquat leaves from the section on fruits in juan 17. This exemplar contains only black characters and small character annotations in double columns — no red characters are present. The MS is now classified as Xinxiu bencao, Text E (戊本 wu ben). It probably dates from the late Tang period.<br>

              The top and bottom of the scroll are fragmentary. The title and author are unknown. It contains 102 columns of text, written on both sides; on the front is the Buddhist Foshuo guan Mile Pusa shang sheng dou shuai tuo tian jing jiang jing wen 佛說觀彌勒菩薩上生兜率陁天經講經文 (Sutra lecture on the Sutra spoken by the Buddha on seeing the Bodhisattva Maitreya born in the Tusita Heaven); this text in 102 columns is found on the reverse. There are seven miscellaneous prescriptions at the beginning of the fragment; notably a recipe for Jinshi yao 金石藥 (Golden stone remedy), a remedy for jifeng 疾風 (ailing from Wind) and a recipe for dihuang wan地黃丸 (pills containing Rehmannia glutinosa). At the end are three verse texts in the ci 詞 form on ‘settling Wind waves’, concerned with distinguishing the symptoms of three cold-induced conditions (shanghan 傷寒) known as yindu 陰毒, jiashi 夾食 and fengshi 風濕. We have attributed the descriptive title Za fangshu (Miscellaneous arts of prescribing).<br>
              The most significant contents of the MS are the recipe for Jinshi yao, the various prescriptions for internal disorders, and the symptomatic distinctions between the three shanghan conditions. It represents an important historical source for the study of compounding drugs in ancient China; moreover, all the remedies described here are of relevance to current clinical practice.<br>
              In this MS, the character飯 (fan), which was prohibited during the Six Dynasties period, is replaced by飰, suggesting that it was written before the Sui and Tang periods.<br>

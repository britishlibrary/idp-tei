              The MS consists of 19 pages bound into an album. The extremities of many pages are defective. Each page contains seven columns of 12 characters, surrounded by a border. The title, headings and author’s name are missing, and the MS is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, IV.<br>
              The text contains a reference to the official Cui Xie 崔協, who lived during the later Tang period of the Five Dynasties and died in 929 CE (see Wu dai shi （五代史[History of the Five Dynasties], Vol. 58). It cannot therefore have been composed earlier than the Five Dynasties period (907-960).<br>
              The volume contains remedies for a variety of diseases.<br>

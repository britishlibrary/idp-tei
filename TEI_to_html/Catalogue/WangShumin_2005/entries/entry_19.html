              S. 9987B is 14 cm. high and 8 cm. wide and contains nine columns of text. S. 9987A is 16.5 cm. high and extends in part to 33 cm. in length. The top of the fragment is mostly intact, but the beginning and end and the lower part are fragmentary. It has 44 columns of text. S. 3395 is 14.5 cm. high and 27.5 cm. long. The beginning and end and the top half are fragmentary. It has 31 columns of text.<br>
              S. 3347 is 28 cm. high and 105 cm. long, and is fragmentary at the top and bottom. It preserves 129 columns of text: the beginning of approximately the first 30 columns and the end of approximately the last 90 columns are missing.<br>
              In 1989 Professor Wang Jiqing 王冀青 of the University of Lanzhou, undertook an examination of the Dunhuang manuscripts in the British Library, in the course of which he discovered that the four fragments catalogued as S. 3347, S. 3395, S. 9987A and S. 9987B corresponded exactly in content, paper type, calligraphy, script, style and ink type, and concluded that they were fragments of the same manuscript. See Chinese Journal of Medical History (Zhonghua yishi zazhi 中華醫史雜誌), 1991, 21 (2), pp. 71-75. On consulting the Dunhuang medical manuscripts in the British Library in July 2001, we were able to see how fragments S. 9987A, S. 3395 and S. 3347 fitted together, and we have now completed an editorial reconstruction.<br>
              According to the preface, this prescription book originally contained 108 single ingredient empirical remedies. It was a patient’s emergency handbook, devoted chiefly to remedies for such common diseases as chili赤痢, baili白痢, cholera, peripartum infections (chanfu fengyi産婦風疾), acute generalised inflammation (bianshen hongzhong遍身洪腫), vomiting and gastric reflux (fanwei反胃), pianfeng 偏風, and sores and ulcers (sheng chuan生瘡). Seventeen specific remedies survive intact and there are traces of a further 84.<br>
              No date of composition or copying is given in the MS. However, there is a reference to Ge Shi 葛氏(Master Ge), which commonly designates the Eastern Jin physician Ge Hong 葛洪 (283-343 A.D.). It implies that some of Ge Hong’s prescriptions had already fallen into disrepute, which suggests a date of compilation some time after his death, probably in the Six Dynasties period (420-589 A.D.) or later. In addition, the writer states in the preface that he intends to have the book engraved on a rock so that it may be widely diffused among the people. There exists at the Longmen cave temples in Henan province a stone stele with an engraved text known as the Longmen prescriptions (Longmen yaofang龍門藥方), dating from 650-653 A.D. (the first to the third year of the Yonghui reign period of the Tang emperor Gao Zong 高宗 ), which has various textual parallels with this volume and according to Zhang Ruixian belongs to the same tradition.<br>
              It can be deduced from these two circumstances that this book of prescriptions was compiled in the Six Dynasties or early Tang period.<br>

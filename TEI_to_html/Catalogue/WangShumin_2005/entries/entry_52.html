              Dunhuang MSS P. 2637 and P. 2703 are identical copies of a book of medical prescriptions without title, headings or author’s name. P.2637 has 76 columns of text and gives eight prescriptions. Since all of these are bigu prescriptions, we have designated this work Bigu zhufang di 1 zhong. P. 2637 is the A text (jia ben甲本), P. 2073 the B text (yi ben乙本).<br>
              The term bigu辟穀denotes an ancient method of physical cultivation (yang sheng養生) involving total abstinence from grain and other foods, which enjoyed a particular vogue during the reign of the Han Emperor Wudi. It was believed that longevity could be attained by refraining from eating any substances which would leave residues to be excreted. This led to a search for practices that might make it possible to go without food. The prescriptions described in this text as Yong quan fang 湧泉方 (prescription of the gushing fountain), Miao xiang wan妙香丸 (fragrant magical pills), Chicao fang吃草方 (herbivorous prescription), and Xiuliang fang休糧方(prescription for abstaining from grain), are all designed to enable the practitioner to abstain from eating grain products without experiencing hunger.<br>

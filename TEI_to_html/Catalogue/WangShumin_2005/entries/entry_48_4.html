            <span class="bibit">A Newly Revised Pharmacopoeia, Text D</span><br>
            
              The MS bears the superscription: ‘Xinxiu bencao xu li juan shang di yi新修本草序例卷上第一’ (Prefaces to the Revised Pharmacopoeia, Volume 1, no 1). There remains the foreword to Xinxiu bencao and the complete text of Tao Hongjing’s 陶弘景preface; the rest of the text is lost (cf. Bencao gaishuo本草概說 [Outline of Pharmacopoeia] by Okanishi Tameto 罔西爲人). It corresponds to the opening section of the first volume of the prefaces to Xinxiu bencao. Unfortunately, the current location of this MS is unknown. The first part of the fragment (i.e. the foreword to Xinxiu bencao) can be studied through the medium of a photograph which was used as the frontispiece to Bencao gaishuo. It is now classified as Xinxiu bencao, Text D (ding ben丁本).<br>
              Comparing this text of the prefaces with versions of the lost text transmitted via other channels (see Zhenglei bencao 證類本草 [Categorised Pharmacopoeia], juan 1), one notices that only the name of the senior official Zhangsun Wuji 長孫無忌, is missing from the list of editors and writers. Zhangsun Wuji was a distinguished official of the early Tang period. Enfeoffed as Duke of Zhao趙國, he held various key posts, including tutor to the Crown Prince and Commander in Chief. But in 659 CE (the fourth year of the Xianqing 顯慶reign period), he committed suicide by official command, after being implicated in an attempted coup (see Jiu Tang shu 舊唐書[Old History of the Tang] juan 65). This can be adduced as evidence that the MS was written after 659 CE.<br>

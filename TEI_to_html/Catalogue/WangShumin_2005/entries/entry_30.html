              Portions of the scroll are missing. It has a text written on each side. On the front is Taixuan zhenyi ben jijing 太玄真一本際經, Volume 4; this book is on the reverse. The title and headings are missing. 247 columns of text survive, containing 210 remedies (two of which appear twice). There is a border at the top and bottom but not at the sides. This text is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, IX.<br>
              Evidence for dating the text is provided by quotations from Gujin lu yanfang 古今錄驗方(Tried and Tested Remedies from Antiquity to the Present Day) and the work of Cui Zhiti 崔知悌. The former is known to have been composed in the Sui-Tang era by Zhen Quan, 甄權 while Cui Zhiti, the author of Cui shi zuan yaofang 崔氏纂要方 (Master Cui’s Compilation of Essential Remedies), was active during the reign of the Tang emperor Gao Zong 高宗 . The MS displays character prohibitions of the Tang emperors Tai Zong 太宗 (VC for葉 [ye]) and Gao Zong 高宗 (療for治 [liao]), but is free from the prohibitions that affected the characters虎 (hu) and旦(dan) under the Tang emperors Gao Zu 高祖 and Rui Zong 睿宗. This indicates that the MS was written after the reign of the emperor Gao Zu but before the reign of the emperor Rui Zong 睿宗, i.e. very close to the actual date of composition. On the other hand, there is considerable confusion in the sequence and numbering of the prescriptions, which precludes its being the original text.<br>
              This book is a heterogeneous compilation of internal and external remedies, gynaecological and paediatric remedies and remedies for disorders of the five sensory organs.<br>

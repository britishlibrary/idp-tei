              Incomplete MS without title or author’s name. The beginning and end, top and bottom are damaged and illegible. Four fragmentary columns of text survive. The British Library arranges this and other fragments on a single sheet. The third and fourth columns of the fragment are also found, in inverted order, in Nanjing: 2 nan 難經·二難 (Canon of Difficulties: Second Difficulty) and in Wang Shuhe’s Maijing (Canon of the Pulse), Vol. 1, Bian chicun yinyang rong wei du shu, 4 辨尺寸陰陽榮衛度數第四. The first two columns do not however appear in the above works. There is evidence that this text consisted of extracts from ancient texts relating to pulse diagnostic techniques. It has therefore been given the descriptive title Unidentified fragment on pulse diagnosis.<br>

              This MS survives only as a fragment without title, rubrics or author’s name. It has not been dated.<br>
              It contains a single recipe for Wushi yao (five stone remedy), to be prepared using stone of five colours (wuse shi五色石) corresponding to the five directions (east, west, south, north and centre) together with five types of grain. The ‘stone of five colours’ appears to relate to the wuse shizhi 五色石脂 (five coloured minerals) mentioned in Shen Nong bencao jing神農本草經(Shen Nong’s Pharmaceutical Canon). The present fragment preserves references only to ‘white stone of the east’ (dongfang baishi東方白石), ‘yellow stone of the north’ (beifang huangshi北方黃石) and ‘[red stone] of the west’ (xifang [chi shi] 西方（赤石）). However the closely similar fragment S. 9936, which also contains a prescription combining five stones and five grains, refers to ‘black stone of the south’ (nanfang heishi南方黑石) and ‘red stone [of the west]’ ([xifang] chishi] （西方）赤石). Because these two fragments appear to belong to variant versions of the same text, we have classified them as Text A (jia ben甲本)and Text B (yi ben乙本).<br>
              Eastern Han period, the famous physician Zhang Zhongjing 張仲景used Wushi tang五石湯 (five stone decoction) as a remedy for disease ; and also He Yong biezhuan 何顒別傳[Supplementary Biography of He Yong] in Taiping yulan 太平禦覽, Vol. 722). There are subsequent references to Wushi zhi yao五石之藥 (five stone remedy), Wushi 五(five stones) and Wushi du五石毒 (five stone poison) in Zhubing yuanhou lun 諸病源候論 (Treatise on the origins and symptoms of disease) juan 5 and 6 and in Qianjin yaofang千金要方(Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces) Volume 24, 3. However, these texts simply record the name of the remedy without directions for its preparation, indicating that this prescription had by then fallen into disuse. The five stone remedy described in fragments A and B probably derives from the earlier five stone decoction.<br>

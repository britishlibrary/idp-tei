              There is a text on each side of the scroll. This treatise is on the front; on the reverse are documents relating to the postal services for 伊西 Yixi and other counties in 667-669 CE (second year of the Qianfeng 乾封reign period to the second year of the Zongzhang 總章reign period). The beginning and end of the MS are incomplete, and the title, headings and compilers name are lost. The surviving text is confined to pharmacological substances in the herbal sections. A comparison of the sources shows that these medicines are discussed towards the beginning of the section on cao 草‘herbs’ under ‘xia pin 下品 (lower grade) of Xinxiu bencao juan 10. In its present form, the MS records 30 of the 35 medicines found in the original. These include 26 medicines from Shen Nong bencao jing 神農本草經 (Shen Nong’s Pharmaceutical Canon) and one from Mingyi bielu名醫別錄 (Additional Records of Famous Physicians). The MS is classified as Xinxiu bencao, Text B ( yi ben乙本).<br>
              The copying of the MS can be dated within the seven years preceding the start of the Qianfeng reign period (666 CE), on the internal evidence of character avoidance of (治[zhi] and世[shi] which have prohibited status, but 恒 [heng] does not): this is corroborated by the year and month of the postal documents on the reverse.<br>
              The main text is written in large characters and the notes in small characters. Among the sections in large characters, the passages from Shen Nong bencao are written in red while the those from Mingyi bielu are written in black (see Mayanagi fig. ). The annotations immediately following the text (in the section on the seven qualities of medicines) are the original notes from Mingyi bielu. The unmarked notes are by Tao Hongjing 陶弘景, while those preceded by the words jin an謹案 (nota bene) are proper to Xinxiu bencao.<br>

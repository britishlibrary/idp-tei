              Wu Zixu bianwen is a narrative text in the popular bianwen 變文form concerning the exploits of Wu Zixu in the Warring States period. It is held in the British Library. It is mostly taken up with Wu Zixu’s adventures on his flight to Wu. It contains a punning conversation between a husband and wife, which plays on the names of medicines, identified in the MS as the Yaoming shi藥名詩 (Poem of the medicinal terms). Although this is not a medical text, it does provide an illustration of the kinds of medicines that were familiar to people of the Sui and Tang periods. Among the Dunhuang MS there are four fragmentary MSS of the Wu Zixu bianwen, which are identified by Wang Zhongmin王重民in his Dunhuang bianwen ji 敦煌變文集 (Collected bianwen of Dunhuang), Vol. 1, as follows: Text A (jia juan甲卷, P. 3213, containing the opening of the tale only); Text B (yi juan乙卷, S. 6331, containing five incomplete columns of text); Text C (bing juan 丙卷, S. 328, which preserves the main body of the narrative, though the beginning and end portions of this MS are missing); Text D (ding juan丁卷, P. 2794, containing two passages of text). The Yaoming shi is missing from the A and B texts.<br>

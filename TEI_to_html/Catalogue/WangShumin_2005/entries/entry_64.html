              The extremities of the scroll are damaged. Title and compiler’s name are missing. It contains 84 columns of text. After column 70 there is a space; l. 71 consists of the character五wu (five), showing that the fourth volume ended and the fifth began at this point. The whole text contains 12 prescriptions, mainly Daoist prescriptions for cultivating health and prowess (yang sheng 養生), including remedies for white hair, loss of voice and boils on the nose. These are now known as the Daoist remedies (Daojia yifang). Since the characters 世 (shi) and 旦 (dan) are subject to prohibition in this MS, it can be dated after the accession of the Tang emperor Ruizong 睿宗, though the actual date of composition must have been earlier.<br>

              The extremities of the scroll are fragmentary, and both title and author are uncertain. It is 28.5 cm. high and 31 cm. long. The words ‘Ling Yang yue 陵陽曰’ (thus spoke Ling Yang) appear at two points in the text. Ling Yang is Yang Ziming 陽子明, originally surnamed Bao 寶, a Daoist of the Han period who was an exponent of the Fu’er 服餌 method of physical cultivation (yang sheng). Ling Yang is an eponym, from the name of the place (Ling Yang) where he led a hermitic life.<br>
              There is a reference in Wang Yi’s王逸 (c. 150CE) Chuci zhu 楚辭注 (Commentary on Songs of the South) to a lost work called Ling Yangzi mingjing 陵陽子明經 (Master Ling Yang’s Brilliant Canon); and the bibliography of the History of the Sui Dynasty (Suishu, Jing ji zi 隋書·經籍志) likewise refers to Ling Yangzi shuo huangjin mifa 陵陽子說黃金秘法 (Golden Secret Techniques as Related by Master Ling Yang). We have therefore designated this MS as Ling Yang jinfang.<br>
              The text consists of 19 lines, containing the latter part of a ‘secret prescription’, followed by an incantation for exorcising and conjuring devils and spirits, and a seven-step Daoist ritual step (qi bu zu七步足).<br>

              The top and bottom of the scroll are defective. It has a text written on each side. On the front is a fragmentary Daoist scripture; this book of prescriptions is on the reverse. 153 columns of text survive. The title, headings and author’s name are missing, and it is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, VI.<br>
              Internal evidence of the date of the text includes a reference to the seventh year of the Tian Bao reign period, i.e. 748 CE, and the stipulation that measurements are in large liang (see third recipe for pills et passim). In conjunction with the prohibited status of the character 旦(dan), which is written as明, this indicates that it was written during or after the mid Tang period.<br>
              The character Hu 虎 occurring in the name of Li Hu 李虎, grandfather of the Tang emperor Gao Zu 高祖, is freely used, showing that it was not then subject to taboo.<br>
              The MS contains 42 miscellaneous remedies for various disorders.<br>

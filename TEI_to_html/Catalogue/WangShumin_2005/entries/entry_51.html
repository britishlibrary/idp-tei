            呼吸靜功妙訣<br>
            <span class="bibit">Huxi jing gong miao jue</span><br>
            <span class="bibit">Wondrous Instructions on the Skill of Quiescent Breathing</span><br>
            
              The MS is intact. There is no title or author’s name. It contains accounts of eight Daoist techniques and spells, viz. Xiang zu baihe zizhi dunfa湘祖白鶴紫芝遁法 (a technique for becoming invisible), Baihe ling zhang zhou白鶴靈彰咒 (an incantation), Zizhi ling she zho jue紫芝靈舍咒訣 (a secret instruction), Heshen suo zai ri qi 鶴神所在日期 (an invocation to the crane spirit), 踏魁罡步法Ta kui gang bufa (a Daoist ritual step), Tai shang jin suo su huan yin dun zhen jue太上金鎖速環隱遁真訣(secret instructions conferring invisibility), Zudi sheng yun fa足底生雲法 (a technique enabling the user to fly). The first seven practices have little medical relevance.<br>
              A note at the beginning of this section refers to the official Han Xiang, who is known to have lived in the ninth century; furthermore the character 治(zhi) is not subject to prohibition in the MS. It is therefore probable that this copy was made in or after the Tang period.<br>
              The section contains 16 columns of text. It is concerned mainly with meditative techniques and breathing exercises aimed at promoting the free circulation of blood and qi, strengthening and consolidating primordial qi (yuanqi 元氣), regulating the seven emotional factors in order to prevent disease. In particular, the practice known as Shenxian zhou神仙粥 (porridge of the immortals) is supposed to act as a tonic in debilitating conditions; enhance qi and strengthen the will; strengthen yang energy and prevent ejaculation. This set of practices is also found in the late Ming work Shoushi baoyuan 壽世保元, juan 4 by Gong Tingxian 龔廷賢, but no source is named and shenxian zhou is omitted. This illustrates the persistence of the non-literary tradition.<br>

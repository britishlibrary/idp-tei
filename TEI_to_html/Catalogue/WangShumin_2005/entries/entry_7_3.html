              The top and bottom of the scroll are damaged. It is 25.5 cm. in height and 80 cm. long, and has a text on each side. On the front is a fragmentary copy of the Daoist scripture Taishang miaofa benxiang jing 太上妙法本相經; this treatise is on the reverse. Fifty-four columns of the text are preserved. The original title is missing, but it has been identified from its content as Zhang Zhongjing’s Wuzang lun, Text C (bing ben丙本).<br>
              The substance of columns 1-31 (approximately 700 characters) of the treatise is common to Wuzang lun, Texts A and B as well as Yifang leiji: Wuzang lun 醫方類聚·五臟論 (A Classified Collection of Medical Prescriptions: Treatise on the Five Viscera) and early manuscript copies. Columns 32-54 (about 500 characters), however, contain much material that is absent from Texts A (jia ben甲本) and B (yi ben乙本). although it is found in Yifang leiju: Wuzang lun.<br>
              The MS can be dated on the evidence of character prohibitions to the early Tang period, i.e. the prohibitions of the Tang emperors Tai Zong 太宗 and Gao Zong 高宗 are observed (葉[ye] is replaced by C and治 [zhi] is replaced by療) but no prohibition is attached to the name character恒 [heng] of the Tang emperor Mu Zong 穆宗).<br>

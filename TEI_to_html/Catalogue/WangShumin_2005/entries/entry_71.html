              There is a text on each side of the scroll. Of the text on the front, only the concluding part survives. It is followed by the words: Bi qiu Daohui suo gong yang jing比丘道惠所供（恭）養經and ...bi qiu Xiangzhi shu比丘項知書. On the reverse is Baiyi wu ben (The Book of One Hundred and One Items), a detailed catalogue of various objects required in the monastic life. This text, which is in a good state of preservation, lists among other things medical and pharmaceutical requisites. It is of great value as source material for the history of medicine.<br>

              The scroll is 28 cm. in height. The beginning and end are intact but the central section is damaged. The text and illustrations run continuously from front to back. The beginning of the treatise, on the front of the scroll, is known as Part I; the conclusion, which is on the reverse, is known as Part II. The texts on the front and back are written in a different hand, and are clearly not the work of the same copyist.<br>
              An inscription at the beginning of the MS records the fact that this is a handwritten copy of a book printed by the Li family of the Tang capital Chang’an, in the eastern sector of the city. This is in fact refers to the earliest known record of a printed book on a medical subject. In a postscript, the two copyists ‘Sheren’ Fan Ziying 舍人範子盈and ‘Yin-yang’ Fan Jingxun 陰陽汜景詢tell us that they executed the MS in close collaboration, completing their work on the 25th day of the twelfth month in the second year of the Xiantong reign period (i.e. 861 CE).<br>
              Part I includes the title of the work and place of printing, a foreword, and a diagram of the moxibustion and acupuncture points of the upper body in frontal view. A diagram of the lower body is present but damaged. It may be conjectured that this was followed by back and side views; but no trace of these remains.<br>
              The contents of Text A Part II are listed in the foreword which states that the text is ‘an overview of the various schools of moxibustion and their wise and efficacious techniques; putting together miscellaneous taboos of the various schools concerning the human spirit according to the year, month and day. However, the earlier sections are lost, although the section on taboos concerned with the human spirit survives in fragmentary form. The MS concludes with the name of the copyists and date of completion.<br>
              The names and locations of the moxibustion/acupuncture points in these charts diverge from the extant classical texts on acupuncture and moxibustion. This is therefore an extremely important primary source for research on moxibustion in the Tang period.<br>

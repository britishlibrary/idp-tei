              The top of the scroll is intact but the bottom is damaged and end are defective. The first column consists of the title of the text and the name (xing and ming) of the author (See Sumiyo Umekawa p. 0) There follows a preface and a verse and prose text in the fu爲 form, relating mainly to guifang qingqu 閨房情趣 (customs of the women’s quarters) and fang zhong zhi dao 房中之道 (sexual practices).<br>
              NB. In the Hanzhi 漢志, Fangzhong 房中(the art of the bedchamber) is one of the branches of knowledge included in the category ‘Fangji’ 方技 (recipes and techniques), together with Yijing 醫經 (the medical canon), Jingfang 經方(canonical recipes) and Shenxian 神仙 (supernatural beings. Moreover, the pre-Song medical texts such as the ancient medical works excavated at Mawangdui, the Qianjin yaofang 千金要方(Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces) and Ishinpō 醫心方, deal extensively with sexual health. In view of this, we offer an edited version of the material concerning medicine and sexual cultivation practices contained in this fu.<br>
              The original author of the fu may be identified as Bai Xingjian, younger brother of the Tang man of letters Bai Juyi白居易. He passed the highest imperial examination (jinshi進士) towards the end of the Zhenyuan 貞元reign period (c. 805 CE) and died during the Bao Li 寶曆 reign period (825-827 CE). His achievements were recorded in the collected biographies of Bai Juyi (Tang shu: Bai Juyi lie zhuan 唐書·白居易列傳). This fu text was not however transmitted.<br>
              NB. After this fragment was unearthed, the first critical edition of the text was undertaken by the late Qing scholar Ye Dehui 葉德輝, who published it in his Shuangmei jingan congshu 雙梅景暗叢書 (The Collection of Shadows under Double Plum Trees). Ye Dehui was a great authority on Classical Chinese literature and his work on the text remains an essential point of reference. However, he was apparently unable to gain direct access to the MS, which obliged him to work from reproductions. With the aid of photographs, it has now been possible to establish correct readings of several corrupt passages, and we offer an emended version here.<br>

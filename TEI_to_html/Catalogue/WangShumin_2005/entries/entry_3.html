              The beginning and end of the MS are incomplete, and the bottom half of the text is lost, leaving intact the top half of 12 lines. The MS has black rulings. The fragment lacks a title or other headings. Because it contains text from Suwen 素問 (Basic Questions), it is catalogued in E cang Dunhuang wenxian 俄藏敦煌文獻 (Documents from Dunhuang Preserved in Russia) as Huangdi neijing suwen (Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor, Basic Questions),Volume 6 黃帝內經素問卷六. But in addition to a fragmentary text of Suwen: Sanbu jiuhou lun (Basic Questions: Treatise on the Three Sectors and Nine Positions), annotations in small characters can be discerned below the fourth line. These notes differ so completely from the two extant classical commentaries on the Neijing 內經 (i.e. Yang Shangshan’s楊上善notes on Huangdi neijing taisu 黃帝內經太素 [Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor, Grand Basis] and Wang Bing’s王冰notes on Huangdi neijing suwen, both written in the Tang period) that they can be assumed to originate with another commentator of the Sui-Tang period. The text is currently designated as Wumingshi zhu — Suwen, Fragment.<br>

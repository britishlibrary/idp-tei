              The top of the scroll is intact but the bottom is defective. As the lower part of this text is largely missing, it cannot be reconstructed as continuous prose.The scroll is 16.5 cm. and 40 cm. long and has a single upper border and ruled lines. It contains 23 columns of text, written in a neat and graceful hand. The title Jiujing mingtang is the original one.<br>
              This text stipulates the acupuncture and moxibustion prohibitions and the hazards of acupuncture and moxibustion peculiar to each of the 30 days of the month. The first section is common to other texts such as the prescription book Qianjin yaofang 千金要方(Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces) and the Dunhuang MSS Xinji beiji jiujing 新集備急灸經(A Canon of Emergency Moxibustion Remedies, Newly Collected) and Renshen liuzhu人神流注(The Flow of the Human Spirit).<br>

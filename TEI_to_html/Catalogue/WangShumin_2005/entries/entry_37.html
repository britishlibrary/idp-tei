              The beginning of the scroll is defective and the upper edge is somewhat damaged. It is 25.5 cm. high and 55 cm. long. It lacks title, heading and author’s name. There is a text on each side of the scroll. On the front is a Buddhist sutra; on the reverse this book of prescriptions, of which 48 columns survive. It is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, XVII. The dates of composition and copying are uncertain.<br>
              The book contains eight sections of general pharmacological theory, four sections of recommendations and prohibitions for women, and 27 prescriptions, mainly restoratives for the art of the bedchamber.<br>

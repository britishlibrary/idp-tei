            <span class="bibit">A Newly Revised Pharmacopoeia, Text A</span><br>
            
              The beginning and end of the scroll are incomplete. It has a text on each side. On the front is a copy of Zhai jing 宅經 (Canon for the Siting of Dwellings) siting canon); this treatise is on the reverse. A comparison with quotations contained in transmitted works confirms that the MS text is the main body of Xinxiu bencao (cf. Zhenglei bencao證類本草 [Categorised Pharmacopoeia]).<br>
              Xinxiu bencao was completed in 659 CE (fourth year of the Xianqing 顯慶reign period of the Tang emperor Gao Zong 高宗 ). It was an official expansion and revision of Bencao jing jizhu 本草經集注(Collected Commentaries on the Pharmaceutical Canon) by Tao Hongjing陶弘景, commissioned by the Tang government and supervised by Su Jing. More than 20 medical officials are acknowledged by name as contributors to this work; at their head, the duke of Yingguo, Li Ji (Yingguo gong Li Ji英國公李勣), and the Commander-in-Chief Zhangsun Wuji 長孫無忌.<br>
              The original work consisted of 54 volumes: the 20 volumes of Xinxiu bencao with an additional one volume index, the 25 volumes of Xinxiu bencao tu新修本草圖together with a one volume index, and the seven volumes of Bencao tujing本草圖經 (Illustrated Pharmaceutical Canon). In the revision more than 400 corrections were made to the previous Pharmacopoeia and a further 100 pharmaceutical substances were added. This work constitutes a systematic compendium of Chinese pharmacological knowledge up to the Tang period. It is the first medical text published in China under official auspices that truly constitutes a pharmacopoeia and as such it predates its earliest European counterpart, the Nuremberg Pharmacopoeia of 1542, by 800 years.<br>
              The MS of Xinxiu bencao discovered at Dunhuang comprises four fragments , which are classified as Texts A, B, C and D (jia ben 甲本, yi ben乙本,bing ben 丙本, ding ben丁本). Text A consists of two fragments. The first of these, which we designate Text A, Scroll I (jia ben jia juan甲本甲卷) is a mutilated fragment of the section on fruits from Xinxiu bencao juan, 17, which is 25 cms high. The second, Text A, Scroll II (jia ben yi ben 甲本乙卷), contains the ending of the section on vegetables from Vol. 18, and the heading of the section on rice and a fragmentary passage on the medicinal uses of flax (huma胡麻) from juan 19, also 25 cms high.<br>
              In this text the character治 (zhi) is subject to prohibition and is replaced by主(zhu), the character世is subject to prohibition, and the character葉 (ye) is subject to prohibition and replaced by C. This indicates that the MS was written during the reign of the Tang emperor Gao Zong 高宗(c. 650-683 CE).<br>

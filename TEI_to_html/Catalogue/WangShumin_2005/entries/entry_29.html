              Portions of the scroll are damaged or missing, particularly at the beginning and end. There is a text on each side. This book of prescriptions is on the front; on the back is a letter from Wang Xi (fl. late C8) to the King of Tibet. Sixty columns of the medical text survive, containing 19 prescriptions altogether. It is decorated with a border at the top and bottom and some passages have been marked in red ink. The title, headings and author’s name are missing, and it is now classified as Unidentified medical remedies, VIII.<br>
              In this MS, the character 治 (zhi), which was prohibited in the Tang period is replaced by療 (liao), but the characters旦(dan) and恒 (heng) are freely used. This indicates that the MS dates from the early Tang period, though the date of composition cannot be established precisely.<br>
              The MS contains miscellaneous prescriptions for jiao qi 腳氣(a disorder affecting the feet), xintong 心痛 (cardiac and other thoracic pain) and nüebing 瘧病 (intermittent fever).<br>

            張仲景五臟論乙本<br>

              The MS is in simple concertina-folded format, with fourteen folds and fifteen pages. Each page is 30 cm. in height and 21 cm. wide with a single border and ruled lines, and contains thirteen or fourteen columns of text. The top of the MS is intact but the bottom is fragmentary. Altogether 195 columns of text survive, containing copies of four books, written continuously. In order, they are Zhang Zhongjing’s Wuzang lun張仲景五臟論, Text B (yi ben乙本); Pingmai lüeli (A Brief Outline of Normal Pulses), Text A平脈略例甲本; Wuzang maihou yinyang xiangcheng fa五臟脈候 陰陽相乘法(The Positions of the Pulses Corresponding to the Five Viscera and the Mutual Overcoming of Yin and Yang); and Zhan wuzang shengse yuanhou 占五臟聲色源侯(Tracing Signs of Disease to the Origin by Divination from the Sounds and Colours Corresponding to the Five Viscera). This text, the first in the sequence, occupies columns 1-83. It is identified here as Wuzang lun, in accordance with the MS heading. It is broadly similar in content to Zhang Zhongjing’s Wuzang lun, Text A (jia ben甲本).<br>
              In the opinion of Luo Fuyi 羅福頤, the MS can be dated on the strength of the script and binding type to the Five Dynasties or early Song period. However, the MS exhibits the character prohibitions of the Tang emperors Tai Zong 太宗 and Gao Zong 高宗 (葉 [ye] is replaced by XC, 世[shi] by人, 治[zhi] by療), while no prohibition applies to the name character旦 (dan) of the Tang emperor Rui Zong 睿宗 or the name character恒 (heng) of the Tang emperor Mu Zong 穆宗 and the Northern Song emperor Zhen Zong 真宗. This points, rather, to a date in the early Tang period.<br>

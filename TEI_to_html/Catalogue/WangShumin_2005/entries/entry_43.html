              This MS was in a state of disintegration. Six fragments now survive, distinguished as juan I, II, III, IV, V, and VI) (jia juan甲卷, yi juan乙卷, bing juan丙卷, ding juan丁卷, wu juan戊卷, ji juan己卷). The beginning and end portions of all the MS fragments are missing, so that they do not follow on from one another. Juan I and II are grouped under the classmark S. 6168, and the remaining four fragments under the classmark S. 6262. Title, headings and author’s name are missing from the originals. They have no counterpart among the extant works on moxibustion. The six fragments, which are now being restored and pieced together, have been assigned the descriptive title Jiufa tu (moxibustion charts). The MS cannot be reliably dated, but a comparison of the script with other MSS supports a date within the Tang period. Five whole-body charts are preserved intact; the remainder are damaged or fragmentary and in some cases, only traces of the accompanying explanations remain. On the strength of the remaining fragments of text and illustration, 18 diagrams can be distinguished. This means that the book must originally have contained at the very least 18 charts of the human body.<br>
              The treatise deals with the identification of various disorders, the therapeutic significance of the moxibustion points and the number of moxibustions to be undertaken. Each section of text was originally followed by a complete diagram of the human body viewed either from the front or from the back, with the moxibustion points shown. On either side of side of each diagram was a key to the names of the moxibustion points. Many of the moxibustion treatments are not paralleled elsewhere, suggesting that they are drawn from the author’s own clinical experience, or that they belong to an oral folk tradition. The treatise also records a number of moxibustion/acupuncture points that are not attested in the extant literature on acupuncture and moxibustion, e.g. banmei板眉, liang jiao wu zhou兩腳五舟, tianmen天門, nieyu聶俞. This indicates that a very wide variety of acupuncture/moxibustion points was in use in the Tang period. This work constitutes the earliest known set of moxibustion charts.<br>

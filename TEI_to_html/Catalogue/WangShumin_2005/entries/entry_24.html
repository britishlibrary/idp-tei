              Portions of the top and bottom of the MS are missing or damaged. There is a separate book of medical prescriptions on each side of the scroll; this text appears on the reverse. It was described in Dunhuang yiyao wenxian jijiao as Unidentified medical remedies, I (Buzhiming yifang di 1 zhong不知名醫方第一種), because no title or headings were thought to have survived. However, on examining the Dunhuang manuscripts in the British Library in July 2000, we discovered a bamboo slip inserted in the manuscript, bearing the heading Zhibing yaoming wenshu 治病藥名文書第, apparently a title added by the copyist. The texts on the front and the back of the scroll have been distinguished as Zhibing yaoming wenshu (Text containing pharmaceutical nomenclature) I and II respectively.<br>
              It is laid out without distinction of large and small characters, and the prescriptions follow on from each other directly, without intervening blank lines. The beginning of each successive prescription is denoted by a red circle. Twenty-eight columns of text are preserved, containing ten prescriptions altogether.<br>
              The MS can be dated to the early Tang period on the internal evidence of character prohibitions. The character 世(shi) in the personal name, Li Shimin 李世民, of the Tang emperor Taizong is avoided; 葉 (ye) is replaced by C; and 治 (zhi) is written without the final stroke. The character旦(dan) is not subject to prohibition.<br>
              The book contains various remedies for deficiency or excess of marrow, for use in treating fulian 伏連, chuanshi傳屍, xuanpi痃癖 (weakness and dyspepsia), guzheng 骨蒸 (bone steaming) and danbing 膽病 (disorders of the gallbladder).<br>

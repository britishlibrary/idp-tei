              There is a text on each side of the scroll. This treatise is on the front; on the reverse is a Buddhist sutra. The scroll, which is 27 cm. in height, is defective at the top and bottom.<br>
              Thirteen columns of the treatise survive. The original title is illegible, but a comparison with the received texts of<span class="bibit">Zhenjiu jiayi jing</span>針灸甲乙經(<span class="bibit">The AB Canon of Acupuncture</span>) reveals close textual similarities with parts of<span class="bibit">Bingxing maizhen, 2</span>病形脈診第二in Volume 4 of that work. It is therefore currently identified as<span class="bibit">Zhenjing: Bingxing maizhen</span>針經·病形脈診(<span class="bibit">The Needle Canon: The Form of the Illness and Pulse Diagnosis</span>). The same passages occur in surviving copies of<span class="bibit">Lingshu jing</span>靈樞經(<span class="bibit">The Numinous Pivot</span>),<span class="bibit">Xieqi zangfu bingxing, 4</span>邪氣臟腑病形第四; in<span class="bibit">Huangdi neijing taisu</span>黃帝內經太素(<span class="bibit">Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor, Grand Basis</span>), Vol. 15,<span class="bibit">Pulse diagnosis of the five viscera</span>(<span class="bibit">Wuzang maizhen</span>, juan 15五臟脈診 卷十五); and in<span class="bibit">Maijing</span>脈經(<span class="bibit">The Pulse Canon</span>) Vol. 3, Sections 1-5.<br>
              The MS does not exhibit any prohibition on the use on the character 世 (shi), which figures in the personal name,Li Shimin李世民, of the Tang emperorTai Zong太宗(the graph 世 is used in the MS in error for 泄). This indicates that it predates his reign (627-649 CE).<br>
              The surviving fragment is in the form of an interrogation. The author asks:‘What types of disorders relate to a pulse that is slow (huan 緩), rapid (ji 急), slight (xiao 小), great (da 大), smooth (hua 滑), jerky (se 澀)?’In his response, he expounds on the types of disorders that may arise when the pulses corresponding to each of the five viscera display these phenomena. For example,‘a rapid pulse of the heart indicates chi 瘛’ (i.e. chizong 瘛疭 , a traditional Chinese medical term referring to spasmodic symptoms); ‘a slightly accelerated pulse is related to xintong yinbei 心痛引背’(i.e. xinjiao tong 心絞痛, angina pectoris). The entire text on the heart pulse is preserved as is much of the section on the lung pulse, but the sections on the liver, spleen and kidney have not survived.<br>

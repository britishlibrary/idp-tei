              The front and reverse of the scroll contain two medical texts. This text is written on the front. No title heading having been discovered, it was classified in Dunhuang yiyao wenxian jijiao as Unidentified medical remedies, II ( Buzhiming yifang di 2 zhong 不知名醫方第二種). However, on examining the Dunhuang manuscripts in the British Library in July 2000, we discovered a bamboo slip inserted in the manuscript, bearing the heading Zhibing yaoming wenshu治病藥名文書, apparently a title added by the copyist. Since there is another text on the reverse of the manuscript, we have designated the text on the front Zhibing yaoming wenshu, I治病藥名文書第一種.<br>
              There are 18 prescriptions, with pharmaceutical names and applications. Dosage and methods of preparation and administration are noted separately in double columns of small characters. The character世 (shi) is subject to prohibition in this text and殜 (ye) is written as ASC, but the characters 治 (zhi) and恒 (heng) are not prohibited, indicating that the MS was written in the early Tang period. The date of composition must therefore be very near the beginning of the period.<br>
              The MS contains miscellaneous remedies for tou xuan 頭眩 (giddiness) and toufeng頭風( headache) and prescriptions to tranquillise the spirit and settle the will (anshen dingzhi安神定志).<br>

      <p>Abstracts of 74 manuscripts containing medical information held in the British Library and the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Institute of Oriental Studies and the Russian Academy of Sciences, St Petersburg, Ryūkoku University Library and Chinese archives. These abstracts have been adpapted and amplified by Wang Shumin from the Dunhuang yiyao wenxian jijiao (The Dunhuang Texts Edited and Collated) edited by Ma Jixing. For ease of reference, they follow the same numbering system. In the course of fieldwork for this project, Wang Shumin was able to identify several fragments as belonging to a single manuscript. The relevant abstracts have been conflated, creating gaps in the original numbering. For the readers' convenience we have cross-referenced the abstracts with the library manuscript cataloguing numbers (beginning with Pelliot and Stein and finishing with the Russian, Japanese and Chinese collections).</p>

Ch.lii.001<br>This painting is one that seems completely at variance with the remainder of the material found in Cave 17 at Dunhuang, and yet it seems undoubtedly to have been part of the paintings found there by Stein. It has to be remembered that the paintings had already been disturbed by Wang Yuanlu before Stein came to Dunhuang, and therefore the possibility exists of his having added to the store something found elsewhere. <br>The subject is Tara, shown here surrounded by eight other Taras, and with subsidiary scenes of Perils, such as falling off a cliff, against which Avalokitesvara would offer protection. These scenes and the Tibetan costumes in the painting offer the closest link to other Dunhuang paintings, but, since the style is entirely Tibetan or Nepalese, and in view of the two lamas seen at the top of the painting, the date must be considerably later than the presumed date when Cave 17 was sealed (early in the eleventh century). It has been included here for the sake of completeness.<br><br>年代不詳<br>麻布設色<br>高66.5釐米  寬40.0釐米<br>斯坦因繪畫 140.Ch.lii.001<br>此畫看起來與敦煌第17窟帶回的其他作品性質完全不同，但的確是斯坦因從第17窟拿來的。據說在斯坦因到達敦煌以前，繪畫類作品已被王圓籙翻亂了，此畫可能是王圓籙從別的地方拿到第17窟的。<br>中央畫著大的多羅菩薩，其左右各排列著四尊共八尊多羅菩薩。空隙中散佈著斷崖墜落圖、觀音伸手救于危難的圖等。從這些危難圖以及菩薩所披的藏式衣裳，雖然可窺出與其他的敦煌畫有密切的關係，但其樣式卻完全是藏式的或尼泊爾式的。而畫面上部的兩尊是喇嘛。從這些特點上看，此畫的製作年代不得不考慮在第17窟封窟（11世紀初）以後。考慮到其比較特殊，且保存完整，在這裏進行了展示。<br><br><br><br><br>

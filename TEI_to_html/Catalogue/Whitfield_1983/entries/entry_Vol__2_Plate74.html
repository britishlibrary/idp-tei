Ch. xxi. 0015<br>The inconsistencies of this painting have been discussed by Arthur Waley in his Catalogue. As the central Buddha holds a beggar’s staff and bowl, he would normally be identified as Bhaisajyaguru, accompanied by the Bodhisattvas of Sunlight and Moonlight. In this case, however, these figures have been labelled Cintamanicakra (on the Buddha’s left) and Vajragarbha. Waley concludes that the painter took a Bhaisajyaguru triad as model and simply added the names of the Esoteric figures without bothering to alter the iconography to suit them.<br>There is no doubt about the tenth century date of this painting, given the general simplification of the features, the squarish outline to the face, the sharply hooked mouthline and the large size of the attendant figures, which fill most of the available space.<br>In one respect concerning its mounting, this painting appears to be unique. A relatively large painting on paper, it is formed of six sheets pasted together before painting and backed with coarse hemp cloth. On the reverse, the hemp cloth was again lined with paper (also six sheets pasted together), and this in turn was attached with animal glue to a wooden lattice with almost square apertures (each H. 10.5 cm, W. 9.5 cm). A flower was painted in each square aperture, the classic combinations of blue with red and green with violet alternating in each row and column. An ink centre was added for each outer petal, and each flower is also outlined in red; the squares in which they are placed are framed in a darker red. The glue lies over these framing lines so that it is certain that the spaces were ruled (probably using the lattice itself as a guide) and the flowers painted before the painting was actually glued in place. The wooden lattice itself was composed of timber approximately 3 cm wide. The flowers recall the actual cut paper flowers also found at Dunhuang (see Vol.3) and bring to mind other floral motifs of the Tang, such as the flowers on the ceiling of the corridor leading to the burial chamber in Princess Yongtai’s tomb (Tang Yongtai gongzhu mu bihua ji, Fig. 2). The painting must have been carefully removed from its window to be deposited in the sealed library and is thus an interesting witness to the deliberate way in which the deposit was made and sealed.<br><br>五代時期,10世紀中葉<br>紙本設色<br>高84.0釐米  寬76.5釐米<br>斯坦因繪畫71.Ch.xxi.0015<br>有關此畫的如下幾處矛盾，Arthur Waley在敦煌畫目錄中已指出。即中尊持錫杖和缽，通常認爲是藥師如來，其脇侍應是日光和月光兩菩薩，但本圖中的脇侍卻分別標爲如意輪菩薩和金剛藏菩薩。對此Arthur Waley推論，畫是以藥師三尊爲原型，圖像未加任何變動，只是像名取自密教像。<br>此圖的全部描繪簡略，從臉部為方型、嘴角描繪成鈎形、兩脇侍畫得大到了幾乎佔滿了空白等看，考慮爲10世紀的作品大概不會有錯。<br>此畫在構造上也極獨特。它作爲紙畫是相當大的，描繪在六張事先粘合的紙上,還用粗麻布作了裱襯，在背面粗麻上又貼上紙（與正面相同也是六張）。再用動物膠粘上約成正方形（每個高10.5釐米，寬9.5釐米）的方格架。方格中是青與紅、綠與紫色組合的古典的彩色花紋，縱橫交錯配置。花紋全部外側的花瓣，均用紅線圈括，採用了墨點相連的暈圈式染色的方法。那方形的圍框是用深紅褐色勾勒。但此線上還殘留著膠，這可能是分割花紋空間的線（也許是只直接粘方格架的）。花紋可能實際上在此畫裝方格架之前，就已經畫在線框內了。方格架是由寬約3cm的四棱木材做成。此花紋又使人聯想起在敦煌發現的剪紙花，同時也想起像永泰公主墓墓道天井的那種唐代的裝飾紋樣等（參照《唐永泰公主墓壁畫》插圖2）。<br>爲將此畫放進石室，要非常小心地從方格架上摘下來。這種製作、收藏時細緻周到的工作，是相當精巧而令人讚嘆的。<br><br><br><br><br>

Ch. 00387<br>This charming painting on paper was evidently painted by the small boy who appears as a worshipper at the left, next to the cartouche, which he left unfilled. Avalokitesvara is depicted complete with all his accoutrements, including Amitabha in the headdress, the willow branch and water sprinkler. Flowers and fluttering scarves are lavished with loving detail: he clearly had a predilection for flowers and himself holds a triple spray, while the double row of petals of the lotus pedestal rising out of a pool are shown decorated. Feet and arms interested him much less than these decorative details or the pair of birds at the bottom, but all features of the painting are those commonly met with in more accomplished paintings.<br><br>唐代末期～五代初期，9世紀末～10世紀初<br>紙本設色<br>高46.0釐米 寬30.4釐米<br>斯坦因繪畫157*.Ch.00387<br>這單純可愛的紙畫，顯然是出自年幼孩子之手，長方形榜題旁邊所繪的少年，可能就是這個繪畫的作者，但榜題中沒有任何文字。觀音的全部裝飾，包括寶冠的化佛、柳條枝、淨瓶等完整無缺。花和擺動的細膩而生動，顯得很可愛。少年手持分成三支的花，可見繪此畫的孩子非常喜歡花。但是，從蓮池外升起的蓮華座，變成了兩排裝飾性的花瓣。另外，對手、足的刻畫遠沒有像裝飾細節或那兩隻鳥使他感興趣，但此畫所有特徵與成熟的作品相同。<br><br><br><br><br>

Ch.xli.004<br>This third example of a stencil shows how varied effects could be obtained through the use of a single original. In this case, the stencil itself may have been produced by pricking through from a design on another sheet of paper. In style it is similar to the two previous designs, but the figure is larger. The figure is not drawn in ink, but the outlines of lotus petals in the nimbus and of wavy lines in the aureole, are picked out in colour and in ink respectively. These lines are of course also pricked. Thus, in transferring the design to the wall the painter could choose between plain nimbus and aureole, and decorated ones, with four possibilities in all (both plain, both decorated, or one plain and one decorated and vice-versa). As with the other stencils, enough remains of the powder on the front surface to testify to frequent actual use, and in addition two register marks in ink at top and bottom presumably mean that it was possible to remove the stencil from the wall to check progress and then replace it.<br><br>五代～北宋初期，10世紀中葉<br>紙、針孔線、部分線描<br>高55.5釐米  寬38.0釐米<br>斯坦因繪畫 73（2）.Ch.xli.004<br>此種紙樣與前兩種不同，展示了可以用一種紙樣取得多種圖樣。圖像本身是用針紮孔的方法從別的紙上摹寫過來的，樣式與前二種相似，但比它們大。只有頭光外區的蓮瓣和身光的波狀紋樣，各自沿著針孔線用紅線和墨線區別開。那是畫家使用此紙樣往壁面轉摹圖像時，區別是否畫頭光或身光上的花紋的標準，全部的搭配可以有四種（頭光身光都沒有花紋的、頭光身光都有花紋的、頭光有花紋身光沒花紋的、頭光無花紋身光有花紋的）。和其他紙樣一樣，此紙樣表面上也殘留有證明其被多次實際使用過的土粉的顔色。此外，爲方便多次將紙樣從牆上取下，瞭解進展狀況後再貼回原處時考慮，在上下的中央位置上，用墨作了利於對照的記號。<br><br><br><br><br>

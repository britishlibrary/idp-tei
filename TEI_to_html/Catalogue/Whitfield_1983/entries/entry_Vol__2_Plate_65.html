It was first published and discussed by Akira Fujieda in Bokubi, no. 177. The subject, as indicated on the first page, is the Guanshiyin pumenpin 觀世音普門品, Chapter 25 of the Lotus, devoted to the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. In Fig. 92, all the pages are shown as arranged by Grinstead, following the order of the sutra. The last few pages are not illustrated, and furnish the text of the short Dicang pusa jing 地藏菩薩経, proof, if any were needed, of the very close association of the two Bodhisattvas Avalokitesvara and Ksitigarbha in the minds of the faithful at Dunhuang at the end of the Tang dynasty.<br>Plate 65-1 shows two pages (20v and 21r). The illustrations show how Avalokitesvara may appear in different forms to preach the Law, according to the needs of individual believers:<br>To those who must be saved in the body of a god, dragon, yaksha, gandharva, asura, garuda, kimnara, mahoraga, human or non-human being, he appears in every such form and preaches to them the Law. To those who must be saved in (the shape of) a Diamond-holding god, he appears as a Diamond-holding god and preaches to them the Law. (Kato, 1971,p.409.)<br>On the left-hand page, the believer kneels in front of a Vajrapani, who, though seated, has all the features, down to the clenched big toe, of the Vajrapani already seen on the silk banner in Vol. 1, Pl. 58. Opposite, on the right-hand page, the other various non-human forms in which the Bodhisattva may appear are collected together as an assembly, so joining the two pages together in a single composition.<br>Plate 65-2 illustrates the following text (pages 27v and 28r of the booklet), the beginning of a verse addition to the sutra, not originally included in the Sanskrit text on silk from Khotan translated by Kumarajiva:<br>Listen to the deeds of the Cry-Regarder,<br>Who well responds to every quarter;<br>His vast vow is deep as the sea,<br>Inconceivable in its acons.<br>Serving many thousands of kotis of buddhas,<br>He has vowed a great pure vow.<br>Let me briefly tell you.<br>(He who) hears his name, and sees him,<br>And bears him unremittingly in mind,<br>Will be able to end the sorrows of existence.<br>Though (others) with harmful intent<br>Throw him into a burning pit,<br>Let him think of the Cry-Regarder’s power,<br>And the fire-pit will become a pool. (Ibid., p. 411.)<br>(汝聽觀音行) 善應諸方所 弘誓深如海 曆劫不思議 時(侍)多千億佛 發大清淨願 我爲汝略說 聞名及見身 心念不空過 能滅諸有苦 假使興害意 推落大火坑<br>Avalokitesvara (Guanshiyin, Regarder of the Cries of the World) is seen on the right with a kneeling believer. On the left the believer is seen in danger from fire: the dragon symbolizes water, so that the illustration completes the sense of the text which continues on the next page (Fig. 92-28).<br>In this way, the whole of the sutra is illustrated, including the verses, which chiefly concern the various Perils from which Avalokitesvara can save the believer. Like the booklet shown in Fig. 95, the illustrations are all at the top of the page with the text immediately below. Such an arrangement is familiar in later block-printed Buddhist and secular narrative illustration, and is also seen in the famous Kako genzai inga kyo 過去現在因果経 scrolls in Japan. The drawings are all basically in ink outline only, probably executed, according to Akira Fujieda, with a “wooden brush” or with a reed pen and with certain details coloured in red or yellow.<br><br>唐代～五代時期，9世紀末～10世紀初<br>紙本設色<br>每頁尺寸：高17.3 釐米， 寬10.0 釐米<br>大英圖書館,S.6983<br>參照Fig.92<br>這本小冊子，是Eric Grinstead先生將散落的單頁重新綴和而成的，因此沒有包括在翟理斯（Lionel Giles）的《敦煌出土漢文文書目錄》中。藤枝晃教授首先在《墨美》177號中提出討論。這本小冊子的主題，正如首頁所示，是《妙法蓮華經》第二十五品《觀世音菩薩普門品》。Fig.92展示了Grinstead按經典的順序排列起來的所有頁數。卷末的三張合頁，雖沒有繪畫，但收錄了短經《地藏菩薩經》。由此可見，唐代末期在敦煌信徒們的心中，觀音與地藏是密切聯繫在一起的。<br>圖65-1展示的是兩葉紙（20紙的背面和第21紙的正面）。圖表現的是觀音說法之時，根據信徒各自的需要變換成各種形象現身，“應以天、龍、夜叉、乾闥婆、阿修羅、迦樓羅、緊那羅、摩睺羅伽、人或非人等身得度者，即皆現之而為説法。應以執金剛身得度者即現執金剛身而爲說法” (Kato, 1971,p.409.)。<br>在左側頁上，信徒跪在執金剛神面前，該神儘管坐著，從腳趾尖用力緊繃的姿势，可以看出與第1卷圖58的絹畫上描畫的金剛力士像有相同的特点。右側頁上集中表現的是觀音變換的各種非人形象，可見左右頁構成一副完整的構圖。<br>圖65-2顯示的是以下内容（27紙背面和第28紙的正面），開頭部分的偈語是後來添加進去的，鳩摩羅什翻譯所根據的于闐絹本的梵文原典，並沒有這部分內容。<br>（汝聽觀音行） 善應諸方所 弘誓深如海<br>曆劫不思議 時（侍）多千億佛 發大清淨願<br>我爲汝略說 聞名及見身 心念不空過<br>能滅諸有苦 假使興害意 推落大火坑(Ibid., p. 411.)<br>右側頁上是觀音（觀世音，觀察世上之痛苦的聲音）以及跪著的信徒。左側頁上爲被火包圍處於危險之中的信徒：龍象徵水，是下頁經文的圖示(Fig. 92-28)。<br>像這樣的包括偈語部分在內的整部經文爲主，以觀音救度信徒的各種危難圖爲中心展開的，如Fig.92所示的，圖繪在各頁的上半部分，下半部分寫經文的這種結構形式，後來不僅用於佛教的經典，而且被廣泛用於通俗小說的插圖中。在日本非常有名的《過去現在因果經》就沿用了與此相同的形式。畫基本上是墨線勾勒的，藤枝教授認爲這是用“木筆”或“葦筆”畫的。有些地方塗了赤茶色或黃色的顔色。<br><br><br><br><br>

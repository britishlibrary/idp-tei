The olive-green of the nimbus and of the lining to the scarves has generally turned brownish. Yellow was used for the jewellery, and an orange wash for the flesh tones. Although the hooked mouthline and flattened scale-like folds over the legs indicate a date near the end of the ninth century, the general care of execution and details such as the headdress where the horns of a crescent moon are still visible (for the complete original motif, see Vol. 3, Pl. 1) clearly reflect the traditions of the early ninth century and before.<br>The headpiece with its floral motif is in one piece with the main panel.

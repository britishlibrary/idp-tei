Ch. xi. 001-2<br>See also Fig. 98<br>A significant number of the manuscripts in the Stein and Pelliot collections are in the form of small booklets (155 in the British Library, 120 in the Bibliothèque Nationale). They have been studied in an article by Jean-Pierre Drège (1979) with diagrams to illustrate the various ways in which a sheet of paper might be folded to form the pages of a booklet, usually with the corners cut or rounded off. The folded pages might be pasted together along the edge of the fold, or sewn, or even left separate as appears to have been the case with the booklet from the British Library illustrating the Guanyin jing (Pl. 65, Fig. 92). In the case of another booklet (Fig. 93), also from the British Library Stein collection, the folded leaves were given a cover extending round the back, and then the whole assembly was fastened together with a braided cord passing through three holes in similar fashion to later Chinese books. The resulting booklets are mostly pocket-sized, convenient for carrying around. One example of this is the rubbing of Ouyang Xun’s Huadusi bei 化度寺碑 (Fig. 97). Three folded leaves survive, giving twelve pages, of which the first two are in Paris and the remaining ten in the British Library. The rubbing, made on thin paper, was cut into strips and pasted on the pages so as to read consecutively. The margins were blackened with ink so as to match the rubbing, except along the centre fold, were each leaf is pasted to the next.<br>The painting shown in this plate was the frontispiece of a booklet of the Diamond Sutra (金剛般若波羅蜜経 Jin gang pan ruo po luo mi jing). The monk kneeling in front of the Buddha and his retinue of attendants must be Subhuti, and the composition is essentially the same as that of the famous printed frontispiece to the scroll of the Diamond Sutra dated A.D. 868 (Fig. 144). From a similar booklet in the Pelliot collection (P. 4096,see Jao Tsong-yi, 1978, Pls. XLⅥ, XLⅦ), we can see that this frontispiece did not come at the very beginning, but followed depictions of eight Vajra kings. The British Museum leaf is an isolated one, but on the back there appears the last of these Vajra kings, with the inscription “The eighth great spiritual Vajra who receives requests”. The other page has a text “to be held in the hand and intoned” (see Fig. 98). For another booklet of the Diamond Sutra in thirty-two sections, with four Bodhisattvas preceding the eight Vajra kings at the beginning of the text, see Fig. 93. The four Vajra kings shown from another isolated leaf must also have adorned a booklet of this very popular sutra (Fig. 94).<br>None of the booklets from Dunhuang is dated before A.D. 868, and this one too appears from its style to be early tenth century in date.<br><br>五代時期，10世紀初<br>紙本設色<br>高14.2 釐米 寬21.2 釐米<br>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 212.Ch.xi.001-2<br>參照Fig.98<br>斯坦因、伯希和兩位收集品的文書類中，有相當數量的小冊子（大英圖書館藏155件，巴黎的國立圖書館藏120件）。關於這些，Jean-Pierre Drège (1979)發表了研究論文，其中附了將一張張紙折疊起來裝訂成冊子的各種方法的示意圖。在那裏，紙角通常是被切掉，或處理成圓形的。折疊後摞在一起的紙，沿折痕用漿糊沾在一起，或用線綴上。但也有像大英圖書館所藏的《觀音經》冊子（參照圖65，Fig. 92）那樣，沒有裝訂，就那樣原封不動地放著的案例。再有，大英圖書館所藏的其他小冊子中，有折紙用封皮包裹，像後世的漢籍一樣，在三處打眼，用線將整本綴訂起來。這樣的冊子本，大都是袖珍本的，便於攜帶。收錄的歐陽詢的化度寺碑拓本（參照Fig.97）就是其中的一種，全冊十二頁，前二頁在巴黎，剩下的十頁收藏在大英圖書館。薄紙的拓本，將其裁成細條，按閱讀的順序貼在折本上，三面的邊用與拓本一致的墨塗成了黑色，由於中間折疊的部分要與下面的拓本用漿糊粘起來，沒有留邊。<br>本圖是《金剛般若波羅蜜經》的扉畫。跪在佛前的比丘可能是佛的弟子須菩提。基本的構圖，與有咸通九年（868年）題記的著名的《金剛經》封皮的背面畫（參照Fig.144）相同。再，根據與伯希和收集品中的同種冊子本（參照P.4096：《敦煌白書》圖錄46，47）的比較，可以清楚此圖是描繪八大金剛的系列畫中的一種。本圖中的畫是從冊子上脫落的，背面一側的頁上，有“奉請第八大神金剛”記錄中八大金剛的最後一位像，其相對的頁上寫有經文“持經梵音……”。而，另外有32張組成的金剛經冊子（參照Fig.93），在八大金剛前面還有四菩薩。還有一葉上的四位金剛（參照Fig.94），也一定是極受歡迎的此經典的冊子本的組成部分。<br>敦煌的冊子本中沒有發現咸通九年（868年）以前紀年的，從此圖的樣式看，應是10世紀初的。<br><br><br><br><br>

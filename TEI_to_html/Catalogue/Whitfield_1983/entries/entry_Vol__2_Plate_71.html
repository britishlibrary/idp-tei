Ch. xl.007<br>This, like Pl. 70, is the Thousand-armed, Thousand-eyed Avalokitesvara in a very simplified form.<br>The eyes are only visible here and there in the great circle of undifferentiated hands. Of all the accompanying figures that we have seen in Vol. 1, Pl. 18, there only remain the lady kneeling with an offering of flowers (possibly Sri devi), and the rishi Vasu with his staff. With the flowers in the top corners, they are symmetrically disposed around the central figure. Among the attributes held by the latter, a scroll and writing brush feature prominently.<br><br>五代時期，10世紀<br>紙本設色<br>高40.0 釐米 寬29.5 釐米<br>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 167.Ch.xl.007<br>與上圖一樣，是簡略的千手千眼觀世音菩薩像。<br>在畫得密密麻麻沒有什麽區別的無數隻手之間，可辨認出稀稀落落的眼睛。眷屬只有第1卷圖18所見諸像中的跪捧花盤的貴婦人（可能是功德天）和持杖的婆藪仙二體。他們左右對稱地在中尊兩邊，上方兩角則畫有花。觀音所持各種物品中，尤其引人注目的是卷軸和毛筆。<br><br><br><br><br>

Ch. 00150<br>Of all the paintings found at Dunhuang, this one remains perhaps the most mysterious. When found, as can be seen from Stein’s illustration (Serindia, Pl. CI), two woodcut prints of Avalokitesvara (Pl. 81 and Fig. 140) had been pasted onto it, covering everything except the string of cash.<br>In the drawing, the string of cash lies in the foreground. On the right, an official inscribes a tablet while facing and apparently listening to the great dragon that kneels in front of him. The dragon has the hooves of a horse; the official too has a hoof instead of a foot, though only a small part of it is now visible. In fact it would appear that the drawing, which exhibits a join down the centre, has been considerably cut down on either side. On the left, the hindquarters of the dragon can be seen to be humped up: one hoof of a hind leg is just visible. Of the explanations offered by Waley and Matsumoto, the most plausible is that the scene represents the mythical Emperor Fu Xi receiving the trigrams from the dragon-horse.<br>According to legend, Fu Xi received the trigrams from a dragon-horse 龍馬 that appeared out of the Yellow River, bearing them on its back, a parallel with the appearance of a tortoise with writing on its back from the Lo River when Yu was controlling the floods. Apart from the horse’s hooves on the dragon, we may note that on its back it bears three prominent rock-like peaks and a voluminous mane quite unlike those of other dragons. Could this unusual combination in fact represent the Yellow River itself from which the animal appears or are the peaks some allusion to the diagrams on its back?<br>Waley himself noted that this explanation was in any case open to the objection that Fu Xi was always represented “with a snake’s body, or at any rate in semimonstrous form”. However, this is quite a different depiction from the usual one of Fu Xi with Nu Wa (see Vol.3), and in any case as the drawing has been cut, we can only guess at the lower part of Fu Xi’s body: all that remains of it is one foot, which, in the plate in Serindia is clearly seen to be another horse’s hoof, and a portion of his robe, which is swept back in an unexpected fashion.<br>One last element in the drawing, the string of cash, suggests a different connection with the dragon-horse, for yansheng qian 厭勝錢, or money with auspicious powers to overcome evil, was in the Song dynasty known as 龍馬錢, or dragon-horse money. Such coins, which were in use in the Han dynasty, are said to be described in the Bogu tu 博古圖 as depicting dragons and horses. It seems at least possible that here these auspicious coins are used to identify the dragon-horse in the Fu Xi legend (see Morohashi, Dai Kanwa Jiten, s.v. 17245/182, 3025/37, 48818/516,518).<br>Since writing the above, Sarah Allan has kindly suggested that the man seen in the picture, who holds an official’s tablet, may in fact be Yu, who received the “writings of the Lo” 洛書 from a “sacred tortoise” while he was still an official under Yao. Yu’s labours and extensive travels in controlling the waters left him permanently disabled, so that while “the tracks of Yu” is a synonym for the whole of China, “the step of Yu” is used of people who are lame. What might then be represented here is therefore a fusion of several elements, namely Yu as official, with a hoof to represent his lameness, recording the “writings of the Lo” on his tablet, but getting them from the dragon-horse, to whom the coins are also an allusion, and whose back seems here to bear mountains and floods. The secret of Yu’s control lay in understanding the nature of water, 禹之制水水之道也. As for the substitution of the dragon-horse for the tortoise, by the late Tang there were many embroidered or garbled versions of ancient legends, and this picture may well be the visual equivalent of such popular stories, the painter having fused the most distinctive elements of two parallel events for greater visual effect.<br><br>唐代，9世紀<br>紙本設色<br>高45.5釐米 寬37.0釐米<br>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 157.Ch.00150<br>在敦煌發現的繪畫中，可以說此畫是最神秘的作品。發現當初，就像《西域》（參見《西域》，圖101）中所見圖版那樣，上面貼著兩幅文殊菩薩的木版畫（圖81和Fig.140），下部除帶孔錢幣以外，其餘完全被隱蓋。<br>這幅畫的前景是用繩索穿著的帶孔錢幣，右方站著官人，傾聽前面跪著的一條大龍的訴説，並用筆記在笏上。龍爪似馬蹄，官人的腳雖然現在只殘留了前面的一點，但也仍可看出是馬蹄的形狀。畫面的中央部位可見紙的接縫，因此當時畫的兩側可能被切掉了相當的部分。龍的背向左上方隆起，左下角還可以略微窺到後腳的蹄。在Waley及松本博士介紹此畫的說明中，最有說服力的，就是表現了古代傳說中伏羲皇帝從龍馬那裏獲得八卦的場面。<br>根據傳說，伏羲是從黃河中出現的背負圖表的龍馬處獲得八卦的。這與大禹治水時，從洛河中出現背負文書的龜的傳說屬同一類型。此龍引人注目的除馬蹄外，還有不見於其他龍的背上三處山岩樣的東西及其濃密鬃毛。這異常的組合，是要由此表示此動物出現在黃河嗎？那山岩一樣的東西暗示龍背上背的是圖表嗎？<br>Waley認爲，此說明存在一個問題，即伏羲通常是“人首蛇身，或至少也應是半獸身”。然而，此圖中的人物形象與通常的《伏羲女媧圖》（見第3卷）完全不同。而此圖中伏羲的下半身，由於畫面被切掉了，我們只能想象，現在殘留的只是一隻腳的腳尖。但從《西域》的圖版中可以辯認出另一只馬蹄，還可見風吹向後方變形的衣襟。<br>此畫中的另一個重要構成是用繩索串起來的硬幣，可能另有深意，即具有驅惡壓邪吉兆之力的厭勝錢，在宋代被稱爲龍馬錢。在《博古圖》中記載，漢代使用的這種硬幣上繪有龍和馬。因此，可以認爲，這也是那种有吉兆的硬幣，至少可以起到了表明伏羲傳說中确定龍馬的作用（參照《諸橋大漢和辭典》17245/182，3025/37，48818/516，518）。<br>就在我寫完上述內容時，Sarah Allan友好地提示：此圖中表現手持笏的男子也許是大禹。禹在奉侍堯帝時，從“靈龜”那裏得到了“洛書”。禹爲治水，不停勞作，又走訪廣大地域，造成終身殘疾。致使“禹迹”這個詞成爲中國全境的同意語，“禹步”這個詞也被用來指的腿腳不靈便的人。因此可以認爲，此畫中的人物是融合了幾個要素的，即禹被表現爲官人的形象，腿腳的不便用馬蹄表現。禹將“洛書”錄在手持的笏上，但那傳授“洛書”的是龍馬。錢幣暗示此動物是龍馬，背上的是山和洪水。這種解釋也能成立。據說禹治水的秘訣，就是 “禹之制水水之道也”。至於以靈龜代替龍馬這一點，到了晚唐時，對古代的傳說有很多都進行了潤色和改變，此畫也與此相同，將兩件事畫入同一個畫面上，將兩者最具特徵的要素組合了起來，獲得更大視覺效果。<br><br><br><br><br>

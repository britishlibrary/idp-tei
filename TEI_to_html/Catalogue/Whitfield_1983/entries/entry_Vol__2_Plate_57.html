Ch. i. 0023<br>Ucchusma, known in China as “the Unclean” because he subdues all unclean influences, appears in several of the paintings from Dunhuang, but always as part of a larger assembly centring on the Thousand-armed, Thousand-eyed Avalokitesvara (see Fig. 55 and Vol. 1, Pl. 18). In this last painting he is identified as the Fiery-headed Vajra, and stands opposite the Blue-faced Vajra.<br>For this painting too, as already noted by Eiichi Matsumoto (1937,pp. 726-27), there is a matching counterpart to Ucchusma, another sketch on the same paper and of approximately the same dimensions, namely the figure identified as Hayagriva, the horse-headed form of Avalokitesvara (Bannières, No. 89). The resemblances are not only in the general attitude and colouring, but in much of the detail as well: the two figures wear the same thick twisted “sacrificial thread” dotted in white, and similar birds’ heads and monster masks appear among the flames that surround them. Matsumoto was in no doubt that the two pieces were by the same artists; one might go further and suggest that they are sketches for two sides of the same composition, perhaps for a wall painting. Such sketches must have been limited in size by the size of the paper available locally, usually in sheets of about 30 cm by 45 cm. Two sheets could be joined by pasting, but larger areas were more difficult. In any case, it is obvious from the lack of back-ground that the figure here is studied as a unit on its own, to be combined with others in the final composition. Thus, this kind of drawing appears rather different in intent from a copy of an existing painting, such as the drawing in the Pelliot collection referred to in the entry on Pl. 16. It should however be noted that, when found, the Stein painting was furnished with a wooden stick at the bottom and a bamboo stretcher at the top, so that it must have been hung at some time as a complete painting in itself, whatever the original intention.<br>From a stylistic point of view, the depiction using short disconnected ink strokes of varying thickness to outline the torso, limbs and face strongly recalls the banners on silk of the late ninth century, such as in Vol. 1, Pl. 58. It does not appear to have become simplified to the extent seen in the Thousand-armed Avalokitesvara in the Pelliot collection, dated A.D. 943 (Bannières, No. 101). A date towards the end of the ninth or the very beginning of the tenth century is therefore proposed for this painting.<br><br>唐代，9世紀末<br>紙本設色<br>高80.7釐米 寬30.8釐米<br>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫40.Ch.i.0023<br>烏樞沙摩明王由於可燒盡世間汙物，在中國被視爲是不淨憤怒，在敦煌的繪畫中也可見到幾例，多出現在圍繞著千手千眼觀音的群像中（參見Fig.55及第1卷圖18）。表現在千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖中時，是以火頭金剛的形象，放在與青面金剛相對的位置上。<br>正如松本榮一博士曾經指出的（參見《敦煌畫の研究》，1937年，726-727頁），有一幅與此烏樞沙摩明王像成對的畫，同樣的紙質上描繪著尺寸大致相同的馬頭觀音（參見伯希和《敦煌幡畫》，圖89）。兩者不僅在像容和色彩上，而且在細節的刻畫上也都有相似之處。如兩像都有粗而扭擰的帶白點的瓔珞，在包圍全身的火焰間畫有鳥頭和獸面。松本博士確信這兩幅畫出自同一作者之手，再按其觀點進一步推測，兩者大概是壁畫兩側的畫的底樣。底樣通常使用30釐米×45釐米左右的當地出產的紙，受其尺寸的制約，即使將兩張紙豎著並排粘接起來，也無法得到更大的幅面。總之，此畫顯然沒有背景部分，因此最終還是要和其他部分組合在一起研究。<br>如上所述，此畫與圖16解說中提到的伯希和藏品中的白描畫一樣，不是對已有繪畫的臨摹，而是新作品的底樣。然而，本圖中的畫在被發現時，下部裝有木棒，上部有竹芯，因此不管最初的意圖如何，其本身曾被懸挂過一個時期。<br>從圖樣的角度觀察，此畫的身體、手腳、臉部等均使用有粗有細的短墨線勾畫的表現方式，讓人想起9世紀末的幡畫，如第1卷圖58。這種表現手法，在伯希和收集的943年的千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖（參見伯希和圖錄《敦煌幡畫》，圖101）中已趨簡化。因此，可以推測此畫繪於9世紀末或10世紀的最初。<br><br><br><br><br>

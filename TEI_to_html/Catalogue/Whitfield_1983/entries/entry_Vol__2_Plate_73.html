Ch. 00197<br>The wall paintings at the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas are so rich in splendid and varied compositions, on which attention has mostly been focused, that the walls actually representing the Thousand Buddhas have been somewhat neglected. Their full effect, in ranks with regular alternation of colour, in some of the caves covering all four walls and the ceiling, can only be felt by the traveller who is able to visit the caves in person. It is a sight and experience he is unlikely to forget, and he will find it in caves of every date at Dunhuang, from the fifth to the tenth or eleventh centuries.<br>Fortunately this great wealth of simple figures of the Buddha has stayed in place, where they can have such an impact on the beholder. But among the material from the Stein collection, there are some links with the Thousand Buddhas on the walls of Dunhuang. One link is provided by the stencils shown in Pls. 78-80 and by further examples in the Pelliot collection, for example, P. 4517 (2), (3), (4), (5), which were probably actually used to produce the wall paintings. Another is the series of paintings of single figures of the Buddha, such as that shown here (Figs. 122-33). There is some evidence that this series, although pasted on paper, was in fact intended to decorate a wall, since, as Stein reported in Serindia, “all have been pasted flat on a stucco surface and are stiff with remains of clay …. The paintings had been made in a series on pieces of paper pasted together in strips, and were afterwards cut up into separate pictures; but the tracing has been badly adjusted, as the join almost always comes in the middle of a figure”. Three examples from the Pelliot collection show why (Bannières, Nos. 44-46): each depicts three figures one above the other. In two the join across the central figure clearly shows, and in these there is also an alternation of colours in the robe, nimbus, lotus petals and so on, those of the top and bottom figures corresponding and distinct from those of the central figure.<br>The Buddhas in the Stein collection are from a different series, without the flowers that adorn the Pelliot examples. However, it is easy to establish that they too were originally arranged in threes, with a join visible in the central figure, always the one in a dark brown robe, seated on a lotus with pink petals, as in this colour plate. Those above and below wear a red robe, are seated on a lotus with uncoloured petals, and show no join in the paper. Since the Stein series has eight Buddhas in dark brown robes (all with the join) and six in red robes (with no join), it can be seen that there must have been many more originally. One more in a red robe is in New Delhi (Ch. 00402) and bears traces of Tibetan characters upside down, possibly suggesting that the paper had been re-used. The drawing is simple and the writing identifying each Buddha very rough, but the figures do not appear to be later than ninth century in date. They must have formed a frieze, three Buddhas high, stuck to the walls of a cave chapel.<br><br>唐代，9世紀<br>紙本設色<br>高26.8釐米 寬22.8釐米<br>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 186.Ch.00197<br>對于敦煌千佛洞的壁畫，出版物最初注重的大多集中于壯麗、構圖富於變化的大画面壁畫本身，而忽視描繪千佛的壁面。千佛虽然色彩變化是規则的，排成几行几段，有的窟裏從四壁到天井都被千佛遮蔽了，其壯觀，不親自去拜訪千佛洞是無法體味的。访问實地，可以见到從5世紀到11世紀的各年代洞窟中的千佛，恐怕其難以忘懷的光景，会总在眼前闪烁。<br>所幸的是，這種千佛的壁畫至今還留在當地，使來訪者受到震憾。但是斯坦因收集品中，也能找出一些與敦煌這種千佛壁畫有聯繫的。其中之一就是圖78至80中的紙樣。結合伯希和收集的各例來看，比如P.4517(2)、(3)、(4)、(5)，大概紙樣是實際用於壁畫製作的。另外一種就是像本圖的這樣，描繪著佛的單像的一系列的繪畫（參照Figs.122-133）。這些畫都用紙做了背襯，實際上是裝飾牆壁的。對於此，斯坦因在《西域》中敍述：“全都貼在灰泥上，上面附著的粘土已變得堅硬……將紙縱向粘合，畫上一連串的畫，然後再分別裁開。但是像和紙接縫處的間隔沒調整好，幾乎每個系列中都有一些像的中間部位有紙的接縫。”看一下伯希和收集品中的三例畫像，此間的情況便可明白。Bannières的圖版44-46都是三尊佛像豎著排列，其中兩例，中央像的正中部位有橫向的紙的接縫。再，這些佛的衣服、身光、蓮花座等顔色的組合是變化的，上段和下段的佛像是相照應的，而中間的像和它們不同，顔色不相合。<br>斯坦因收集的系列佛像中，沒有伯希和收集品中見到的那種花的裝飾，明顯是另外組成的系列。但這些原本也是三尊佛像縱著排列的，中間的像上可見紙的接縫。如本圖的像，著暗褐色衣服，坐在淡紅色花瓣的蓮花寶座上的像上都有紙的接縫，是中央部位的像。上邊和下邊的佛像沒有紙的接縫，著紅衣，坐在沒有彩色的蓮花座上的像的位置。現在大英博物館中，著暗褐色衣服的像（都有接縫）有八尊，著紅衣的像（無接縫）有六尊。可以推測，原先還應有很多這樣的佛像。新德里國立博物館中也有一尊著紅衣的像（Ch.00402），本来应该有更多的像。新德里博物館的藏品上，還帶有倒著書寫的藏文，可能這显示了紙張的再利用，與像本身無直接的關係。描绘簡略，附在各像上的名字也寫得潦草，但佛像看起來不會是9世紀以後的。這些畫可能是三尊组合豎著貼在石窟壁上的。<br><br><br><br><br>

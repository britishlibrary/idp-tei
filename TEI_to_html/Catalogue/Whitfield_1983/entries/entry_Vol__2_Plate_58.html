Ch. 00162<br>This painting and that of Yama-deva (Fig. 109) belong to the same series, both being rather crudely drawn and simply coloured with brick-red, pale bluish grey and pale greenish brown.<br>While I have followed Arthur Waley’s identifications of these two pictures, precise identification may need to await further study of the special features of Dunhuang iconography by competent experts. Waley drew attention to the fact that this figure and the bird on which he is mounted resemble the Golden-winged Bird King seen to the right of the large Thousand-armed, Thousand-eyed Avalokitesvara (Vol. 1, Pl. 18-8). For the present I should merely like to note that nearly all of the iconographical elements, both in this painting and in Fig. 109, appear to have been taken from that painting or another Thou-sand-armed, Thousand-eyed Avalokitesvara. The figure mounted on the bird holds the skull-stick, which is an attribute held in one of Avalokitesvara’s forty principal hands. Against his breast he holds a child grasping a ball or globe. The same child holding a red ball is found in a similar position with Mahesvara (Vol. 1, Pl. 18-10). <br>In both cases the reference is to the role of the figure holding the child (whether Brahma or Mahesvara [Siva]) as creator of all living things. Further elements taken from the same source can be seen in Fig. 109, where Yama-deva (still adopting Waley’s identification) is a six-armed figure of fierce aspect, holding the sun and moon, a vase and a rope, and standing on a bull. The bull strongly resembles Mahesvara’s vehicle (Vol. 1, Pl. 18-10), with the head in the same attitude-even though the body of the bull is turned the other way –and the forefoot extended in the same fashion. The six-armed figure recalls, though not so closely, the depiction of Mahakala (Vol. 1, Pl. 18-2), and the four objects that he holds all among the attributes held by the forty principal arms of Avalokitesvara.<br>Whether considered from the roughness of the style or the apparently hybrid iconography, this painting and Fig. 109 are of a somewhat different nature from Pl. 57, despite being related to the same subject. While Pl. 57 might have been a preparatory sketch for a new painting, these appear to be more experimental in character, combining various elements perhaps had special meaning for the painter or his patron. The date would seem to be late ninth or possibly early tenth century.<br><br>唐代末期～五代初期，9世紀末～10世紀初<br>紙本設色<br>高46.0釐米  寬31.3釐米<br>斯坦因繪畫 166.Ch.00162<br>本圖與Fig 109焰摩天圖屬於同一系列，都用簡單的墨線描繪，加了磚紅色、淡青灰色、淡綠褐色等簡單的色彩。<br>這兩幅作品的定名，我目前仍然沿用Arthur Waley的判斷，精確的定名尚需有能力的專家依據敦煌圖像學作進一步的研究。Waley注意到此圖中所乘坐的鳥，與大幅千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖（第1卷圖18）右下部所見的金翅鳥王有類似的地方。而我目前只能指出這幅畫以及Fig. 109的圖像因素不只採自這幅千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖，而且還採自其他千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖。<br>本圖中的像乘坐在鳥背上，手持千手觀音的主要四十隻手持物品之一的帶髑髏的手杖，胸前抱著持珠童子。千手千眼觀世音圖中同樣位置也有胸前抱童子的摩醘首羅天（參見第1卷圖18-10），那童子也持紅珠。雙方（本圖是那羅延天即毗瑟紐神，其他是摩醘首羅天即濕婆神）均懷抱童子，這標示着萬物創造者的角色。Fig. 109中的像，也同樣可見從此千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖中汲取的素材。那焰摩天（目前採用Waley的定名）是充滿力感的六臂像，手持日月和水瓶、絹索，站在雄牛上。首先，那頭雄牛與摩醘首羅天乘坐的牛（參見第1卷圖18-10），頭的姿勢相同，而這頭牛身體則轉向它方，兩隻牛一隻前蹄均伸向前方，姿勢相同。六臂的像，雖然並非非常接近，但可使我們想起摩訶迦羅天（參見第1卷圖18-2），焰摩天所持四件物品都在千手千眼觀世音菩薩四十隻手所持的物品中。<br>以上所述，可以認爲本圖和Fig.109在風格粗略、圖像混合這一點上，與圖57的特性略有不同，儘管其表現的題材是一樣的。圖57是為新畫作準備的畫樣，既含有很多實驗性的因素，也凝結了畫家或捐助者特殊的各種需要。其年代可能在9世紀末或10世紀初。<br><br><br><br><br>

Ch. liv.0011<br>Painted on a single sheet of the coarse paper used at Dunhuang, and devoted to the ever-popular Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, this painting is typical of those affordable by the less wealthy devotees of Buddhism. Eiichi Matsumoto (1956, p. 69) has suggested that the donor, Suo Janger, a shoemaker, inscribed it himself, putting his profession in place of the usual rank and position of donors who were officials. Matsumoto has also noted that Suo was a common surname in the Dunhuang area during the Tang dynasty. The style and colouring are typical of paintings on paper from the mid-tenth century.<br><br>五代時期，10世紀中葉<br>紙本設色<br>高44.5 釐米,寬31.2 釐米<br>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫30*.Ch.liv.0011<br>此畫是敦煌常用的粗紙，畫的是通常人們熟知的觀世音菩薩，可以說是標準的由生活不怎麽富裕的佛教徒供奉的畫。松本榮一博士在《敦煌畫拾遺1》中指出，此畫的供養人索章三是位鞋匠，在有官職的供養人記錄官名或位階的地方，寫著他的職業“鞋匠”，這一點很引人注目。博士還指出，唐代的敦煌姓索的人很多。樣式和色彩上，可以說是10世紀中期紙畫中的典型。<br><br><br><br><br>

Ch.0069<br>This painting has already appeared in Vol. 1, Fig. 111, but on account of its importance, both for iconographic and stylistic reasons, a detail of the fragment is shown here.<br>Vaisravana is shown standing in a strictly frontal pose, his right hand firmly grasping a halberd-banner. He wears close-fitting armour, with a leopard skin over the hips and a small sword suspended in front. An animal head, with goat-like horns and well furnished with sharp teeth, gapes at the shoulder.<br>Unlike the single figures of Vaisravana that been seen in the banners (Vol. 1, Pl. 65, Figs. 109, 110), the king is here accompanied by a gandharva wearing a leopard-head helmet, with the skin covering both shoulders and knotted at the front. A similar figure is constantly seen in attendance on Vaisravana, for instance in the Bhaisajyaguru paradise (Vol. 1, Pl. 9) where he is playing a pipa (the gandharvas were musicians attendant upon Indra, with apsarasas as their wives). In the present fragment, however, he is carrying by the neck an animal readily identifiable as a mongoose, symbolic of Vaisravana’s original identity as Kuvera, the Indian god of wealth. In his other hand, the gandharva holds a flaming pearl. While the same objects can also be found in the depiction of this figure in a woodblock print dated A.D. 947 (Fig. 153), the life-like depiction of the mongoose in the Stein fragment strongly suggests that it was closely based on an Indian prototype, since the mongoose was not familiar to the Chinese artists, and has shrunk to the point where it is a almost unrecognizable in the print. The type is well known in Indian sculpture from the eighth century onwards, but earlier paintings are of course missing. Consequently this fragment assumes a greater importance, particularly since, from the point of view of style, it almost certainly dates from the eighth century. This will be clear if the brushwork, in accurately drawn fine lines, is compared with that of the large iconographical painting. Details such as the delineation of Vaisravana’s eyes and frowning countenance or the shape of the attendants’ feet correspond rather closely to the same features in the iconographical painting shown on page 306.<br><br>唐代（8世紀）<br>絹本設色<br>斷片全圖：高74.0釐米 寬31.0釐米<br>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫 38.Ch.0069<br>此畫已收錄在第1卷單色圖版第111圖中，但無論在圖像上還是在樣式上都是非常重要的作品，因此，在這裏将其细部郑重提出。<br>毘沙門天正面而立，右手持帶幡長槍。身披緊身合體鎧甲，腰圍豹皮，前面挂著小劍，肩上有頭頂山羊角、張開大口露出尖牙的獸頭。<br>與畫著毘沙門天獨像的幡畫（參照第1卷彩色圖版第65圖、單色圖版第109圖、110圖）不同，此處的毘沙門天伴著肩披豹皮在胸前繫結的乾闥婆。與乾闥婆相似的形態，在毘沙門天的眷屬中常常見到，如在藥師淨土變相圖中（參照第1卷彩色圖版第9圖）手持琵琶的形象（乾闥婆，既毘沙門天的妻子天女，又是侍奉帝釋天的樂伎）。在本圖的斷片中，是右手抓著貓鼬的脖子，貓鼬原象徵著毘沙門天在印度作爲財富支配者的俱鞞羅，左手托著火焰寶珠。在有開運四年（947年）紀年的木版畫（請參照單色圖錄第153圖）上，可見到有與此相同的乾闥婆形象，但貓鼬的姿勢卻非常奇特，看上去不像是貓鼬，貓鼬對於中國的畫家來說，沒有見過，是不瞭解的。與其相反，本殘片中所見的貓鼬，實在是栩栩如生，這一點讓人強烈地感覺到此畫是深深地紮根於印度的原型。此形式的像，在8世紀以後的印度雕刻中較常見，但那以前的繪畫當然不存。而此畫從樣式上看大約是8世紀的，可以說是件極其珍貴的作品。說此是8世紀的，將此畫準確流暢的運筆，與同時代大畫面的像比較，自然會明白。此毘沙門天的眼、皺眉的面部表現，再有乾闥婆的腿的表現手法，與散見於釋迦瑞像圖（參照彩色圖版第11圖解說部分的插圖.參照第306頁諸像）中的各部分很相似。<br><br><br><br><br>

                                    - Five Dynasties, mid-10th century A.D.<br>Ink and colours on paper<br>H. 42.7cm, W. 30.0 cm<br>British Museum, Stein painting170. Ch. lvi. 0033<br>This sheet of the usual rather thick.Dunhuang paper is framed by a bold wave-pattern border. The area within it is divided, with two figures standing on clouds above and the inscription in Chinese together with talismanic formulae below. Each of the two figures is accompanied by a cartouche in which the donor of the painting places himself directly under their protection. The planet Ketu is on the right, standing on a green cloud, now corroded away, and the star of the northern quarter is on the left. This last figure is represented like the figure of Mercury in Vol. 1, Pl. 27 (mislabeled Jupiter in the plate caption), as a woman holding a writing brush and book.<br>The Chinese inscription below reads:<br>Whosoever wears in his girdle this talisman, which is a dharani talisman, will obtain magic power and will have his sins remitted during a thousand kalpas. And of the Ten Quarters all the Buddhas shall appear before his eyes. Abroad in the world he shall everywhere encounter good fortune and profit. Throughout his whole life he shall enjoy other men’s respect and esteem. His religious merit shall be unparalleled, and this protection and purification shall come to him as swiftly as Lu Ling rides. (Trans., Waley, 1931, p.165.)<br>此符陀羅尼符帶者得神通除罪千劫十方<br>諸佛惣在目前去者無不吉利達一世得人恭<br>敬功得無比護淨急急如律令<br>The talismanic formulae seen to the right of the Chinese inscription are similar in form to those used until recent times for Daoist talismans, written in red for greater effect and employing repetitions of characters or parts of characters in similar fashion to the elaboration of characters in seal script in official seals. As in modern talismans, parts of recognizable characters also appear. Although no attempt has been made to decipher it, this part of the talisman must surely convey a similar meaning to that written in Chinese.<br><br>

Ch. 00377<br>This Bodhisattva is depicted in almost the same fashion as Tara or Avalokitesvara in the preceding plate, but with frowning countenance and with the addition of the emblems of the sun and moon. The inscription in this and that in the following painting are preserved almost complete. In each case it consists of a description of the figure, the number of the painting and the name of the painter or donor, these three parts being separated by vertical lines. Because the reading is somewhat difficult in parts to make out, the transcription of the Tibetan is given here first, followed by the translation:<br>[Sta]-bla-ma-phyogs-kyi-mgon-po-steng-gi-ham-(hum)- tshigs-thams-cad<br>Kha-so-brgyad<br>The-god-za-leg-mos-bris<br>The Holy Lord of the Directions [who is accompanied by] all the Hum mantras of the space above<br>Kha-38<br>Painted (?) by Leg-mo, the noble lady (?) of The-god<br>The figure is here tentatively identified as Akasagarbha, Lord of the Sky, who is sometimes depicted with fierce or frowning countenance (Mochizuki, 1973-74,p. 1136c) and whose cult is closely related to that of Avalokitesvara. The right hand is in vitarka-mudra, which is in accord with the description given by Getty, who also gives the sun as Akasagarbha’s symbol (Getty, 1928,p.101). The sun and the moon are frequently seen in this position in paintings of the Thousand-armed Avalokitesvara. The numeral in the centre must simply refer to the number of the painting in a sequence or series; it is given in two forms, both the abbreviated syllabic system and in ordinary notation. Hugh Richardson, to whom I am indebted, as I am to David Snellgrove and Lama Chime Rimpoche, for assistance with this inscription and the one in Pl. 49, suggests that Leg-mo has a feminine termination (mo). If so, then it would appear that Leg-mo was a noble lady who commissioned the painting, rather than the actual painter.<br>The canopy is depicted in the same spare and loose way as the figure, being more of a linear design than a depiction of a three-dimensional cover over the figure. In this it somewhat resembles the shape of the canopies in Pls. 52 and 53,both of which are probably tenth century in date. But the inscriptions in Tibetan, and the concern for the shape of the figure beneath the scarves, suggest an earlier date. It is possible that this and the two other drawings of the series are datable towards the end of the period of Tibetan control. That is around the middle of the ninth century A.

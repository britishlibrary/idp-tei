Ch.00421<br>Among the woodblock prints from Dunhuang, long rolls with multiple impressions of the Buddha, or of Bodhisattvas, form an important part. In the Pelliot collection at the Bibliotheque Nationale, twelve different kinds have been identified. This plate and Figs. 155-62 show the kinds to be found in the Stein collection at the British Museum. Where possible, these have been reproduced actual size to simplify comparison and give an idea of their effect. Most of them were printed in ink, but some were printed in red and those shown here were enhanced with colour added by hand after printing. In all cases it will be seen that each image was individually printed, causing irregularities and overlaps. In one example (Fig. 156), we have a fascinating glimpse of the devotion that inspired the creation of these celebrations of the omnipresence of the Buddha. The image is a very simple one of the Buddha seated and holding an alms bowl, without nimbus and with only the minimum of detail. A date is written in ink at intervals throughout the surviving fragments of this scroll, which is on thin paper of good quality, possibly eighth century in date. These dates are written after every twenty-one impressions, following the same sequence in every month: the eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, twenty-third, twenty-ninth and thirtieth days of the month. These must have been the fast days of the Buddhist calendar. We can imagine this and other such scrolls being steadily filled up with images, their creation bringing merit for the Buddhist believer who possessed such a stamp, or who brought his scroll to the temple for stamping.<br>Despite the gap in time and distance, it is instructive to compare these Dunhuang scrolls with those preserved in Japan from the late Heian period, for instance those from the Joruri-ji (Baskett, 1980, nos. 2-4; Ishida, 1964, Pls. 33ff). These are extremely close in style and appearance to the Dunhuang prints, but there is an important difference in actual execution, for they are not individually stamped but printed in blocks, some in blocks of twelve, others in a block of one hundred. The block of twelve consists of four rows of Buddhas with three in each row. Six impressions on a sheet made a total of seventy-two. With the block of one hundred images each row of ten is similar to the one below it, and it is therefore believed that a block of ten images was first carved, and that ten successive impressions from it were pasted down and carved in a new block of one hundred. This method of creating ten, a dozen or one hundred images at a time is a fascinating example of Japanese adaptation of a form derived from China. It was of course much more efficient, but it could only have developed in the absence of the individual small locks that were used to stamp the Dunhuang scrolls. What the Japanese were following were in fact just such scrolls imported from China: to obtain more it was only necessary to paste a group of impressions together on a block, and carve anew. We can thus explain at once both the astonishing stylistic affinities between the Chinese and Japanese examples of different dates, and the differences in their execution and use (the) Japanese printed sheets were enshrined within statues rather than remaining in constant devotional use).<br><br>唐代，9世紀<br>紙、木版墨印、淡彩<br>一版（一身像）：高10.7釐米 寬9.3釐米<br>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫254.Ch.00421<br>敦煌攜來的木版畫中，印刷上多個佛或菩薩像的長卷子本的形式，是非常重要的一類作品。巴黎的法國國立圖書館收藏的伯希和搜集品中，可辨出有12種。大英博物館收藏的斯坦因搜集品中，除本圖外，均展示在Figs.155-162中。單色圖版所示是各木版的原來尺寸，便於查看它們的效果以及相互比較。大部分畫都是墨印的，其中也有赤印的，也有像本圖，印後塗上色彩的。哪一種排列都不整齊，有的歪斜重疊，可以看出像是一尊一尊地印上去的。尤其是Fig.156中千佛的版畫，滲透著創作它的信徒讚歎佛遍滿世界的感情。那佛手持鐵缽端坐，沒有背光，是最小限度地描寫，非常簡潔。印在可能是大約8世紀的上等薄紙上，有些地方還有筆寫的日期。其日期每隔二十一尊就有一次，每月都限在八日、十四日、十五日、二十三日、二十九日、三十日。這些日子可能是佛教徒的齋戒日。不難想象，信徒們認爲持有這樣密密麻麻並排印著佛像的卷子本，就能帶來功德。<br>以這些敦煌卷子本，比較淨琉璃寺的木版印刷的千體佛等日本平安時代以後的作品，雖然兩者的時間和地點相差很遠，卻很有意義。這些樣式和體裁上，與敦煌的極相似，但在製作上面，卻有大的區別。這些不是將佛像一尊一尊上印上去的，而是十二尊或一百尊作爲一塊印製的。十二尊的版木上，佛像是三尊一排，共有四排並列，印六次就能印出七十二尊。百尊的版木上，每列有十尊佛，而且每列上的像都是相同的。因此，可以想象，這是先刻出一列有十尊的版木，再用它印出十張貼在木板上，刻出新的百尊的版木。這種一次十尊、十二尊，甚至能印出百尊佛像的方法，在將中國的形式進行日本式改造的事中，是最具魅力的事例之一。毫無疑問，這種方法大大提高了效率。但也可以說，是因为那些敦煌通常用的一尊佛像的小版木沒有傳來，才想出來的。從中國傳來的只有卷子本，爲了得到大量的這種卷子，産生出將一組佛像貼在版木上，將其刻成一塊新的版木的方法。因此，就不難理解，中國和日本不同時期的卷子，卻像上面所述的，在樣式上有著驚人的相似性，同時其製作方法和用途卻有著顯著的不同（在日本，比起日常的信仰，更多地是爲了將其放入佛雕像之胎內）。<br><br><br><br><br>

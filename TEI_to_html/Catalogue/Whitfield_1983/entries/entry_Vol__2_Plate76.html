Ch.00226<br>see also Fig. 77<br>Both these paintings are reproduced substantially larger than actual size. Surviving manuscripts from Nepal on pothi leaves often feature an illustration between two sections of text, whereas here the picture occupies the whole length of the leaf, being simply superimposed on the area previously ruled in red.<br>Considerable use is made of gold in the upper leaf, which shows monks and a Bodhisattva adoring the Buddha. The lower leaf, featuring two Buddhas and two monks on either side of a flaming jewel is coarse in execution and colouring. In the tenth century manner, the figures fill the whole available height and the spaces between are entirely filled with leafy branches. These features can also be seen in a set of three rectangular paintings on paper (Figs. 111-13). The foliage in the lower leaf here resembles that of some other tenth century paintings: the stems and some of the leaves were first outlined in ink, then a green wash was applied with large touches of the brush. Finally the stems and all the leaves were outlined again in darker ink.<br><br>五代～北宋時期，10世紀<br>紙本（朱格線）設色  <br>高8.0釐米  寬35.7釐米<br>斯坦因繪畫 193*(1).Ch.00226<br>參照Fig.77<br>76、77兩圖的圖示，比實際尺寸稍放大了些，但其本來就比普通的高約5 釐米的尼泊爾梵夾要大一些。尼泊爾的梵夾通常在兩側寫經文，圖繪在中間。而這裏展示出的梵夾，則是預先用紅筆劃上格線，橫著在紙上畫滿了圖，這一點有所不同。<br>圖76畫的是讚歎佛說法的菩薩與比丘，此畫用了不少金箔。圖77畫的是火焰寶珠的兩側有二佛和二比丘，描線和色彩稍顯粗糙。遵循了10世紀的繪畫手法，將尊像縱向繪滿，像與像之間，畫有繁茂葉子的樹枝。這種表現手法，在三組長方形紙繪（參照Figs.111～113）上也能見到。尤其是圖77上樹叢的表現手法，與10世紀的幾幅畫非常相似。先用墨線描繪出幹與葉，再大筆觸地塗上綠色，最後用濃墨將幹和葉的輪廓再勾一遍。<br><br><br><br><br>

Ch. 00211<br>Of this booklet only the cover and one loose page found inside it remain; they are shown side by side in this plate. The cover is of purple cotton, finely woven in a diaper pattern, and with the sides and top and bottom edges all turned in and pasted down to prevent fraying. As can be seen in the plate, the front cover has an extra strip of the same material, sewn to it and folded so as to enclose the back cover when the book was shut. This strip and the whole front cover are stiffened with an endpaper, pasted in, and of double thickness behind the folded strip. The paper is ruled, and towards the left bears the characters 八金剛名 “Eight Vajrapanis” and the remains of streamers and scarves of a figure from the first left-hand page. Probably the booklet began with figures of the Eight Vajrapanis, as in some other examples already mentioned in the notes to Pl. 67.<br>The loose page clearly shows where was originally pasted in a booklet along a 5 mm strip down the right side. At the top a strengthening tab extends beyond this to the right, and it was clearly at one time pasted behind the endpaper. Since this page with its finely executed painting was once attached in this way on the right and is now damaged in all the same places as the back cover, it must for a long time have been the only contents of the cover. In other words, it would seem that the cover of a Diamond Sutra booklet was adapted to serve as protection for this picture alone, without any text.<br>The painting is, in miniature, very similar to a larger painting in the Pelliot collection (Bannieres, No. 202) and to another booklet in the same collection, with a page of text as well (EO 3566). Marici, holding a fan, descends with her two attendants on a purple cloud towards a kneeling couple in late ninth or early tenth century dress at the right. The whole scene is set over the sea, with a beautifully depicted range of hills and trees at the top of the picture, and rays radiating from the sun disc in the upper left corner.<br>As Eiichi Matsumoto has pointed out, the iconography of this scene preserves the flavour of an earlier time, before the majority of Chinese three-headed, six-armed forms of the goddess. This would seem to bear out what can be deduced from intrinsic features of the composition, such as the headdresses of the attendants and their sensitive grouping round Marici, which seems to reflect earlier ninth century conventions, although the kneeling donors can hardly date before the end of the Tang.<br><br>唐末～五代初期，9世紀末～10世紀初<br>紙本設色<br>图案部分：高14.3 釐米  寬10.0 釐米<br>斯坦因繪畫 207.Ch.00211<br>此冊子本只剩下封皮和夾在裏面的一張紙，圖版中是橫著並排顯示的。封皮是用織有細小的菱形花紋的赤紫色棉布作成的，上下和斷面部分的邊緣爲防止開綻而向裏折疊，並用漿糊粘貼。圖版展示的封皮，右側爲書脊，左側爲開口，開口上縫著相同布的細布條，合上書時其繞過封皮紙，整本書就完全合上了。其封皮和細布條的裏面，貼著封皮的襯紙，又在細布條處粘了一張紙。襯紙上畫有格線，左邊寫著“八金剛名”。其左邊相對頁上的畫，還殘留有佛像天衣的一部分。可能此冊子本與上圖解說中舉出的，在卷首畫有八大金剛像的一些例子，同屬一類。<br>圖版左側，是脫落的畫的部分，其右側還可見寬約5毫米的塗了漿糊的痕迹。根據上部殘留的固定此畫右側的加固材料，可以斷定此畫是粘在冊子本最後的。而此畫的破損方式和封皮的破損方式大體一致，可以想象，在相當早的時候，其他的部分就丟失了，在很長一段時間裏，就只剩下這一頁夾在封皮裏面。換言之，此《金剛經》冊子的封皮，在很長一段時間裏沒有伴隨經文，而只起到了保護這一頁畫的作用。<br>此圖幅面非常小，構圖與伯希和收集品中的大畫面的圖（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌的幡和繪畫》篇圖版第202圖）以及同收藏品冊子本（EO3566）中的一頁很相似。手持麈尾的摩利支天與兩侍女，乘着赤紫色雲，向跪著男女供養人的畫面右下角方向下降，男女供養人身著9世紀末到10世紀初的衣裳。場面設定在海上，畫面的上方繪有遠景的山、森林等。再有，左上角繪有日輪，從那裏放射出紅色的光線。<br>正如松本博士所指出的，此画的圖像表現手法殘留著較早時期的特點，是用三頭六臂或八臂表現摩利支天的密教形成之前的。事實上，此圖的摩利支天和侍女們的構成方式、侍女們的髮型等基本的表現手法，可以確認是遵循了9世紀初的慣例，但右下角跪著的供養人像的表現方法，很難認爲是唐代末期以前的。<br><br><br><br><br>

Ch.00159<br>See also Fig. 138<br>This is the largest and most impressive of the several stencils found at Dunhuang, and furthermore shows clear signs of actual use. As can be seen from the monochrome plate of the whole (Fig. 138), it shows a complete group with central Buddha, two Bodhisattvas and two monk disciples. Only the figures of the Buddha and of the attendants on his left are drawn in ink. To produce the attendants on the Buddha’s right, the whole (assembled from several smaller sheets of paper) was folded down the middle and holes were pricked following the ink outlines, right through both layers of paper. Close examination easily reveals the direction in which this was done.<br>The stencil was used for the production of repeated designs such as are seen in Cave 61 at Dunhuang itself. There a very similar five-figure group appears on each of the four faces of the ceiling, completely surrounded by smaller individual Buddhas taking up exactly half the height of the central group. The design was transferred to the wall by introducing a reddish powder (tuhong 土紅), found locally, through the holes. After removing the stencil the small marks left on the wall could then easily be joined up to form the design. Traces of this powder can still be seen on the front surface of the stencil, showing that it was actually used. There is therefore a possibility that the wall paintings produced through its use may still exist in the Dunhuang caves.<br><br>五代～北宋初期，10世紀中葉<br>紙、墨畫、針孔線<br>整體紙樣：高79.0釐米  寬141.0釐米<br>斯坦因繪畫 72.Ch.00159<br>參照Fig138<br>敦煌的紙樣中，這是最大的也是最漂亮的，而且有實際被使用過的痕迹。Fig.138可見紙樣的全圖。佛坐於中央，其兩邊是兩比丘和兩菩薩。佛與左側的比丘、菩薩是用墨畫的。右側的像，則是將整幅畫（將六張紙粘接在一起）從中心線對折後，用針沿著墨線紮出的許多小孔穿透兩層紙而得到的。因此，這種作品，研究一下就能知道哪一側是先畫上去的。<br>紙樣是用來製作類似敦煌第61窟那種，相同圖案反復出現的壁畫。第61窟的天井四周，繪的是與此非常相似的五尊佛，周圍密密麻麻地圍滿了只有其一半高的小如來群即千佛。紙樣的圖案，是用本地出產的叫土紅的一種紅色的粉末摹寫在壁上。在紙樣上塗上這種粉末，粉末就會透過針孔沾在牆上，描紅以後畫圖就容易了。本圖所示紙樣的正面，現在還殘留著沾的粉末，證明被實際使用過。因此，在敦煌石窟的某個地方，還可能有用此紙樣製作的壁畫。<br><br><br><br><br>

Ch. 00160<br>See also Fig. 100<br>This small work on paper was perhaps the frontispiece for a sutra roll. Despite considerable loss of pigment, it is still extremely attractive. Its simple grouping is immediately reminiscent of Sui and early Tang preaching groups in the wall paintings at Dunhuang, and the very attitudes of the two Bodhisattvas, their bodies gently swaying and their hands in graceful gestures of adoration of deference, likewise attest their early date. The Buddha, his hands in vitarka-mudra, is more solidly three-dimensional than Sui parallels in the cave paintings. His fully round face and the stylized folds of his robes seem to place him closer to the High Tang Buddhas on the east wall of Cave 103 than to the early Tang group on the east wall of Cave 322 (Chugoku Sekkutsu, Tonko Makkokutsu, vol.3, Pls. 19, 156). The petals of the lotus throne on which he sits are swelling and rounded. All these features seem to indicate a date in the eighth century.<br><br>唐代，8世紀<br>紙本設色<br>高25.0 釐米  寬18.0 釐米<br>斯坦因繪畫 165.Ch.00160<br>參照Fig.100<br>此小型紙畫，可能是經卷的卷首畫。雖然顔料已剝落了相當部分，但現在依然很漂亮。只有三尊佛組成此畫的簡潔構圖，使人想到敦煌石窟中隋及初唐時期壁畫中所見的說法圖。而且兩脅侍菩薩略扭的腰部，優雅的手姿，也顯示了其時代之早。另一方面，兩手結說法印的坐姿中尊佛，遠比隋代的石窟壁畫更具立體感。其圓滿的面部表情和模式化的衣褶線，比起第322窟東壁初唐時期的像，更靠近第103窟東壁盛唐時期的像（參照《中國石窟  敦煌莫高窟》第3卷圖版19、156）的表現。中尊趺坐的台座，蓮花瓣圓潤豐滿。將這些特點全都綜合起來看，此畫應是8世紀的。<br><br><br><br><br>

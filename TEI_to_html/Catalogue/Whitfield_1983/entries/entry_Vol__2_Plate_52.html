Ch. i. 009<br>Avalokitesvara is seated on a ledge of rock against a rising full moon in the same pose as in a painting on silk in the Musée Guimet (Bannières, No. 101), which indeed it very closely resembles also in such features as the small leaves flanking the lotus blossoms, and the new pointed bamboo shoots in the grove immediately adjacent to the Bodhisattva. The painter of the Guimet painting, however, has been more successful in rendering the pendent leg correctly related to the three-quarter view of the figure, instead of its being uncompromisingly see in profile as it is here. The Guimet painting is dated A.D. 943. The costume of the donor in the painting shown here is also consistent with a mid-tenth century date. In style and colouring, as well as in details, such as the form of the canopy and the small cloud descending with the figure of a king and two attendants (Pl. 52-3), the painting is very close to that in Pl. 53.<br>In the landscape setting, the water patterns are executed in a very lively manner by ink lines. Ink modelling in broad swathes has been applied both to the rounded slopes and to the sharp vertical banks in the foreground.<br><br>唐代末期～五代初期，9世紀末～10世紀初<br>紙本設色<br>高82.9釐米 寬29.6釐米<br>英国博物館,斯坦因繪畫15.Ch.i.009<br>此觀世音菩薩像坐在背面有很大滿月的岩石上，與集美美術館中的《千手千眼觀世音菩薩圖》下段所見的水月觀音（參照伯希和圖錄《敦煌幡畫》圖101）的姿勢相同。兩圖中，蓮花兩邊的小葉子、觀音旁的竹叢中繪有筍等方面，都非常類似。但踏蓮華的左腳，在本圖中的完全繪向側面，而在集美美術館繪畫的構圖中，卻與身體的方向斜向一致。<br>集美美術館的繪畫中有天福八年（943年）的紀年，本圖中供養人像的著裝與它的相同，有10世紀中葉的特點。另外，此畫不僅是風格和色彩，華蓋的形狀、乘小雲彩降下的國王和兩個侍女等細部的描寫（參照圖52－3），都與圖53極其相似。<br>看其山水的描繪，在水面上有墨線繪出的躍動著的波紋，圓形的斜坡與前景中陡峭的岸邊，使用了寬墨線。<br><br><br><br><br>

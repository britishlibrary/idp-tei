Ch. i. 009<br>Avalokitesvara is seated on a ledge of rock against a rising full moon in the same pose as in a painting on silk in the Musée Guimet (Bannières, No. 101), which indeed it very closely resembles also in such features as the small leaves flanking the lotus blossoms, and the new pointed bamboo shoots in the grove immediately adjacent to the Bodhisattva. The painter of the Guimet painting, however, has been more successful in rendering the pendent leg correctly related to the three-quarter view of the figure, instead of its being uncompromisingly see in profile as it is here. The Guimet painting is dated A.D. 943. The costume of the donor in the painting shown here is also consistent with a mid-tenth century date. In style and colouring, as well as in details, such as the form of the canopy and the small cloud descending with the figure of a king and two attendants (Pl. 52-3), the painting is very close to that in Pl. 53.<br>In the landscape setting, the water patterns are executed in a very lively manner by ink lines.

Nevertheless, despite the shortcomings in technical skill, the depiction is quite successful in the figures of the cringing prisoners, the stern kings delivering judgement and the court attendants who stand behind them, with smug expressions and caps with distinctively curled ribbons (Pl. 64-1).<br>Each scene is accompanied by a title specifying the time (seven days after death, thereafter every seventh day until the forty-ninth day, on the hundredth day, and after one and three years) for the soul’s appearance before each king and a gatha, or text in verse. At the beginning of the scroll there appears a messenger on a black horse (Pl. 64-2). This is in accordance with a passage from the sutra about Preparatory Practice for the Ten Kings and Life during the Seven Weeks: “Yama the dharma king addressed the Buddha saying: Ye World-Honoured One! I and all the other kings must send a messenger riding on a black horse, holding a black banner, and dressed in black clothes to inspect the merits performed by the families of the deceased. Then he will find their personal documents, and he will release the sinners in accordance with our vow.” (Dainihou zokuzokyo 大日本続藏経 I/23/4, based on a printed Korean version of A.D.1469, translated by Lothar Ledderose, paper read in Cleveland, March 1981.)<br>閻羅法王白佛曰世尊我諸王皆當發使乘黑馬 把黑幡着黑衣檢亡人造何功德准名秋陳抽出罪人不違誓願<br>Ksitigarbha is seen twice in this scroll: seated in a building where the fifth king, Yama, is judging a sinner being shown his past crimes in a mirror and standing at the end in a hell scene (Pl.64-5) which is almost a reversal of that seen in Pl. 63. There must have been many such scrolls: another in the Bibliothèque Nationale (Pelliot chinois 2870 R) resembles the British Library scroll, having the messenger with his black horse and banner at the beginning of the scroll, after a frontispiece. In the two scrolls shown here, the means of depiction appears to be the same, with the main outlines of the figures executed with a wooden pen, and colours and washes added with the brush. Naturally the texts are also written with a brush.<br><br>北宋時期，10世紀中期～末期<br>紙本設色<br>高28.0 釐米 長約495.0 釐米<br>大英圖書館,斯坦因3961<br>此畫卷的描繪遠比上圖細緻，但絕非出於上等畫家之手，尤其是出現在若干場景表現稚拙，使人感覺是業餘畫家的習作。但在充滿畏懼的亡靈們、進行威嚴審判的十王，站在十王背後自鳴得意、戴著奇形怪狀翹起的襆頭的侍者等人物的刻畫上還是非常成功的(Pl. 64-1)。<br>每個畫面代表死者经过的每个特定时段（死後的每隔七日，直到四十九日、第一百天、周年、三周年），表现亡者在每個冥王面前的情景，並有韻文詞句。卷首表現的是乘黑馬的冥府使者（參見圖64-2），此與下述《十王經》序中記述的一節是相對應的：閻羅法王白佛曰：世尊，我諸王皆當發乘黑馬，把黑幡，著黑衣，檢亡人造何功德，准名秋陳，抽出罪人不違誓願（大日本續藏經I/23/4 1469年的高麗版經，Lothar Ledderose翻譯，1981年3月在美國Cleveland學習）<br>地藏菩薩出現在兩個畫面。在第五王閻魔王以鏡子映出罪人過去的罪狀進行審判的場面，坐在建築物中，以及卷末站在地獄中與圖63的位置相反（參見圖64-5）。此類畫卷可能有很多：巴黎國立圖書館藏品中有（參見P.2870R）畫著乘黑馬、持幡的冥使的卷子，與本圖的畫卷相似。上圖與本圖的兩個畫卷，人物像的主要輪廓線都用木筆描繪，色彩則用毛筆添加，表現技法是相同的，文字部分自然是使用毛筆寫的。<br><br><br><br><br>

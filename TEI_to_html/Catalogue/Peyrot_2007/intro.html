      <p>PRELIMINARY NOTE</p>
      <p/>
      <p>If you see square boxes below, the font does not display well. The text is in unicode and you can adjust the font in your internet browser.</p>
      <p>   If you use Internet Explorer, you have to go to 'tools', then to 'internet options', and in 'general' you should set the latin based web page font to a unicode font such as Arial Unicode MS, Gentium or TITUS Cyberbit Basic (the latest version of Times New Roman is also fine). Also in 'general', you have to switch on 'Ignore font styles specified on Web Pages' under 'accessability'.</p>
      <p>   If you use Mozilla Firefox, you have to go to 'tools', then to 'options' and under 'content' you can set the default font to a unicode font (Arial Unicode MS, Gentium, TITUS Cyberbit Basic or the newest version of Times New Roman). Next to the settings for the default font, there is a button 'advanced', where you can switch off 'Allow pages to choose their own fonts'. It seems however, that Firefox automatically selects a unicode font to avoid the square boxes: probably you will have a mixture of two different fonts.</p>
      <p>   For the codes of the special characters, see further below.</p>

      <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Though a number of scholars have been working on the British Tocharian fragments, notably Sylvain Lévi, Emil Sieg and Wilhelm Siegling, George S. Lane, Walter Couvreur and J.W. Broomhead (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Broomhead_1962" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Broomhead_1962</a>), the collections have for a large part remained inaccessible to most of the scholarly world. Lane has never published British fragments, Lévi, Sieg and Siegling and Couvreur published only a limited number of fragments, and the only systematic treatment, that of J.W. Broomhead, was a PhD thesis that remained unpublished, and still contained only part of the fragments (for a description of the British Tocharian fragments, see <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Malzahn_2007a" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Malzahn_2007a: 84-91</a>).</p>
      <p>   Initially in collaboration with Mr Tatsushi Tamai, I have prepared this transliteration and provisional transcription of IOL Toch 1 - IOL Toch 308 and IOL Toch 353 - IOL Toch 822 as part of the TITUS Tocharica Project at Frankfurt University. With the exception of IOL Toch 309 - IOL Toch 352, which consist of Sanskrit fragments only, I have tried to transliterate all fragments systematically, in order to obtain a good overview over the collection. This means that many Sanskrit fragments and some in Tumshuqese are treated too.</p>
      <p>   The edition has come about in several steps. The first step consisted of a correction of the edition of Broomhead within the framework of the TITUS Tocharica Project in May and June 2004. For this work I could use an electronic version of Broomhead's edition that had been prepared by Paul Widmer, also for the TITUS project. During my second stay in Frankfurt in December 2004, I included the unedited fragments IOL Toch 308 - IOL Toch 822. In the third step, it was agreed to publish the edition on the website of the International Dunhuang Project, and a revised transliteration with a transcription was completed in September 2006. The fourth step was the conversion of the word file, which it had been up to that moment, into a marked-up xml file. When in October 2007 the xml file was finished, the edition was published on the IDP website. (On this second edition, see below.)</p>
      <p>   I know that my edition will not have a long-lasting value like for instance that by Sieg and Siegling (e.g. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Sieg_Siegling_1953" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Sieg_Siegling_1953</a>), which, apart from being of very high quality, also contains systematic indications on the content, remarks on e.g. the metre of metrical passages, and many valuable notes and restorations. However, it is regrettable that since 1908 much research has been delayed or impeded by a much too slow publication of the texts, and it is hoped that this edition will be a stimulus for further research on the British fragments; in particular, I think that a full transliteration of the texts available will facilitate the identification of texts and research on particular words. For any comments on my transliterations or the content of the fragments, I will be very grateful (for my address, see below).</p>
      <p>   For the Tocharian fragments IOL Toch 853 - IOL Toch 1247, see Tamai's electronic edition on this website (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Tamai_2007" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Tamai_2007</a>); cf. also his edition of the Tocharian fragments of the Or. 15003 series (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Tamai_2006" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Tamai_2006</a>).</p>
      <p>   I would like to thank Prof. Jost Gippert, Dr. Agnes Korn and the late Peter Olivier of the Frankfurt TITUS crew for their warm welcome, their advice and technical support, and most of all, of course, Tatsushi Tamai. Tatsushi has not only taken the initiative to have the London Tocharian fragments digitised, he was also the one who invited me to join the TITUS project: he has always been there to help deciphering the fragments and he was always prepared to discuss all kinds of problems related to Tocharian and Tocharian manuscripts. In the final phase, I could never have done without the great help of Sam Van Schaik, who invested much time and effort in developing the right format of the xml file and made the necessary adjustments to the IDP website.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRESS MARKS</p>
      <p/>
      <p>The fragments are arranged according to the new "IOL Toch" press marks, and the catalogue numbers of this edition are parallel to the IOL Toch numbers. It is, however, also possible to search for fragments using the old Hoernle press marks. For a concordance of Hoernle press marks, cf. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Peyrot_2007a" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Peyrot_2007a</a>.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMAGES</p>
      <p/>
      <p>It seems that the links from this edition to the corresponding images work fine: you can use the press mark under 'ITEM' to go to the photos of the Tocharian fragments. The opposite direction is also possible, but there is a technical problem with press marks divided into different fragments (e.g. 'IOL Toch 353(a)', 'IOL Toch 353(b)' etc.); in these cases, you can see the corresponding edition via the catalogue number ('CAT NO.').</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CONTENT</p>
      <p/>
      <p>If the content of a fragment is known, this is indicated in italics under the press mark. I have chosen to copy all the remarks about the content from Broomhead's 'Table of Contents' (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Broomhead_1962" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Broomhead_1962: iv-v</a>), indicated by "(Broomhead)", even if it is only a personal name mentioned in the fragment.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>REFERENCES</p>
      <p/>
      <p>For technical reasons, references follow the transliteration. In principle, all editions are noted, but translations are taken from the (as yet incomplete) list of translations in <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Peyrot_2006" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Peyrot_2006</a> and <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Peyrot_2007b" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Peyrot_2007b</a>.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TRANSLITERATION</p>
      <p/>
      <p>The transliteration follows the conventions of Sieg and Siegling (i.e. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Sieg_Siegling_1949" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Sieg_Siegling_1949: 7</a>, <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Sieg_Siegling_1953" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Sieg_Siegling_1953: 9-10</a>). Some differences are that no restorations are proposed in the transliteration, but only in the transcription, and a second type of brackets has been added, " ‹ " and " › ", to indicate damaged characters that are still reasonably clear; the traditional " [ " and " ] " are used for uncertain readings, just like in the editions of Sieg and Siegling. The dot over an akṣara with virāma is noted as " ˎ, ". Some substitutions of the characters traditionally used for transliteration were needed: superscript " ä " is rendered by high dots " ¨ "; subscript " ä " is rendered by " ǟ ";  subscript " u " is rendered by " ȗ "; subscript " ī " is rendered by " ȋ "; subscript " a̱ " is rendered by " ȃ̱ ". A special character is used for the old long " ī " (" ·I· "): " Ī "; its subscript variant is " Ȋ ". In the transliteration, the doubling stroke is rendered by " ‡ ": thus, " k‡ " in the transliteration corresponds to " kk " in the transcription. The Tocharian punctuation signs are rendered by " • ", " : " and " || ".</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TRANSCRIPTION</p>
      <p/>
      <p>In the transcription, the transliteration brackets have been left out, whereas restorations are as usual indicated with " ( " and " ) ". If they are not mentioned in notes, corrections have been indicated with " { " and " } ".</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ENCODING</p>
      <p/>
      <p>I have tried to use as many unicode characters as possible. Since not all Tocharian letters have a unicode character, some had to be combined. The monolithic characters are " ḵ " (1E35), " ṯ " (1E6F), " ṉ " (1E49), " ṟ " (1E5F), " ḻ " (1E3B). The characters " a̱, p̱, m̱, ś̱, s̱ " are combined out of normal " a, p, m, ś, s " and the combining underscore " x̱ " (0331). A special case, however, is underscored " ṣ ", which is combined out of normal " s " and " x̝ " (031D).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>NOTE ON THE SECOND EDITION</p>
      <p/>
      <p>The first edition of these transliterations and transcriptions was made available on the website of the International Dunhuang Project in November 2007 (it can be downloaded <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/downloads/Peyrot_2007_1stEd.xml" target="_blank">here</a>). In this second edition, some minor typographical errors have been corrected. Furthermore, important observations of Dr Dieter Maue on IOL Toch 36 have been incorporated (hopefully to be published soon in "Tumschukische Miszellen II"), as well as his edition of IOL Toch 81 (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Maue_2008" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Maue_2008</a>). Some corrections of verbal forms are based on suggestions by Dr Melanie Malzahn in her forthcoming book on the Tocharian verb, whereas I could make corrections in IOL Toch 127 thanks to critical remarks by Prof Heiner Eichner. I would like to thank all of them for their kind help.</p>

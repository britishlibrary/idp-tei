      <p>PRELIMINARY NOTE</p>
      <p/>
      <p>If you see square boxes below, the font does not display well. The text is in unicode and you can adjust the font in your internet browser.</p>
      <p>If you use Internet Explorer, you have to go to TOOLS, then to INTERNET OPTIONS, and in GENERAL you should set the latin based web page font to a unicode font such as Arial Unicode MS, Gentium or TITUS Cyberbit Basic (the latest version of Times New Roman is also fine). Also in GENERAL, you have to switch on ‘Ignore font styles specified on Web Pages’ under ACCESSABILITY.</p>
      <p>If you use Mozilla Firefox, you have to go to TOOLS, then to OPTIONS and under CONTENT you can set the default font to a unicode font (Arial Unicode MS, Gentium, TITUS Cyberbit Basic or the newest version of Times New Roman). Next to the settings for the default font, there is a button ADVANCED, where you can switch off ‘Allow pages to choose their own fonts’. It seems however, that Firefox automatically selects a unicode font to avoid the square boxes: probably you will have a mixture of two different fonts.</p>
      <p>For the codes of the special characters, see further below.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TRANSLITERATION</p>
      <p/>
      <p>The transliteration follows the conventions of Sieg and Siegling (i.e. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Sieg_Siegling_1949" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Sieg_Siegling_1949: 7</a>, <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Sieg_Siegling_1953" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Sieg_Siegling_1953: 9-10</a>). The traditional " [ " and " ] " are used for uncertain readings, just like in the editions of Sieg and Siegling. The dot over an akṣara with virāma is noted as " ˎ, ". Some substitutions of the characters traditionally used for transliteration were needed: superscript " ä " is rendered by high dots " ¨ "; subscript " ä " is rendered by " ǟ "; subscript " u " is rendered by " ȗ "; subscript " ī " is rendered by " ȋ "; subscript " a̱ " is rendered by " ȃ̱ ". A special character is used for the old long " ī " (" ·I· "): " Ī "; its subscript variant is " Ȋ ". The Tocharian punctuation signs are rendered by " • ", " : " and " || ".</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ENCODING</p>
      <p/>
      <p>I have tried to use as many unicode characters as possible. Since not all Tocharian letters have a unicode character, some had to be combined. The monolithic characters are " ḵ " (1E35), " ṯ " (1E6F), " ṉ " (1E49), " ṟ " (1E5F), " ḻ " (1E3B). The characters " a̱, p̱, m̱, ś̱, s̱ " are combined out of normal " a, p, m, ś, s " and the combining underscore " x̱ " (0331). A special case, however, is underscored " ṣ ", which is combined out of normal " s " and " x̝ " (031D).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>For an edition of the Tocharian fragments of the Or. 15003 series, cf. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Tamai_2006" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Tamai_2006</a>; for an edition of IOL Toch 1 - IOL Toch 822, cf. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Peyrot_2007" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Peyrot_2007</a>.</p>

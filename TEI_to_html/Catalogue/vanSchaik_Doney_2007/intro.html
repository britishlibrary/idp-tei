      <p>The manuscript presented in translation here, Pelliot tibétain 149, contains a brief
                historical narrative that illustrates the change from imperial to religious history
                in Tibet. The text probably dates from sometime
                between the late ninth and late tenth centuries, within Tibet’s ‘time of
                fragmentation.’ This period is often depicted in traditional and modern scholarship
                as a ‘dark age;’ indeed, owing to the paucity of historical literature from the
                period, it has been difficult to identify the sources for the early chos ’byung
                accounts. Thus the narrative in Pelliot tibétain 149 might be helpful in this
                regard; though it cannot be identified as a direct source for any of the extant
                Buddhist histories, it may be considered the kind of source that historians of the
                eleventh century onward would have utilized. </p>
      <p>Pelliot tibétain 149 is actually the narrative setting for a single Buddhist text, a
                prayer known as the <span class="bibit"> Bhadracaryā-praṇidhāna</span>. This
                narrative, like the later Tibetan Buddhist histories, begins in India, and continues
                through to the imperial period in Tibet, specifically the period of the reign of
                Tsenpo Khri Srong lde brtsan (r. c.754–797?). Also in line with most of the later
                histories, but unlike the Old Tibetan Annals or Old Tibetan Chronicle, Pelliot
                tibétain 149’s narrative focuses on religious lineage rather than royal
                succession.</p>
      <p>The manuscript contains the story of Sudhana’s quest for the <span class="bibit"> Bhadracaryā-praṇidhāna</span>, which leads him to the bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī
                and Samantabhadra. Obtaining the prayer from the lat- ter, he is able to reach the
                spiritual level (bhūmi) of ‘utter joy.’ The scene of the narrative then shifts to
                Tibet, where the prayer is trans- lated into Tibetan as part of the great
                translation project undertak- en during the reign of Tsenpo Khri Srong lde brtsan.
                The tsenpo’s priest, Dba’ Dpal byams, has a dream, which the Indian abbot
                Bodhisattva (known in other historical sources as Śāntarakṣita) inter- prets. The
                dream indicates that Dba’ Dpal byams must recite the <span class="bibit"> Bhadracaryā-praṇidhāna</span> for three days and nights. Dba’ Dpal byams fails
                to uphold this commitment, and so asks Khri Srong lde brtsan if he can go to a more
                spiritually conducive place. With the tsenpo’s blessing he travels towards the caves
                of ’Ching pu, where he meets two Tibetan monks who have experienced omens indicating
                that they should meet up with Dba’ Dpal byams. The three travel together and,
                reciting the prayer, ascend to the pure land of Sukhāvati.</p>

      <p>ORIGINAL PREFACE</p>
      <p>A translation of the Kharoṣṭhi documents published at the present time must necessarily be far from perfect. Obscure passages remain to be cleared up; the meaning of many words is still unknown. Nevertheless it is time the attempt was made, since it is essential for further advance in the study of the many questions, philological and other, connected with the documents, that they should be made accessible to a wider circle of schoalrs than has hitherto been the case. this can only be done by a translation, literal, and as accurate as possible.</p>
      <p>A great deal, of course, can be made out with certainty. In such cases the straightforward translation is given. In many cases where the meaning of a word is not known, the rest of the sentence is clear, and is translated with the unknown word in italics. Titles like <span class="bibit">cozbo</span>, etc., whose meaning is known roughly are normally left in italics. Wherever there is doubt about the rendering of a particular passage, a question mark is added in brackets at the end. When nothing can be made of a passage, a space in brackets containing a question mark is inserted. Lacunae in the original are represented by a line of dots within squared brackets. Set phrases that occur again and again are not translated after the first time, being identified by etc. and a line of dots.</p>
      <p>No extensive annotation is given. The basis of the interpretation is to be found in my <span class="bibit">Language of the Kharoṣṭhi Documents from Chinese Turkestan</span>, to which the reader is referred. Short notes are made (a) to correct the readings of the text, (b) wherever the information in the above work needs to be supplemented or corrected. At the end of the volume there is an index of the words thus discussed in the notes. An asterisk is placed before new words resulting from improved readings, a cross before those which should be deleted. A certain amount of other information on individual words is also incorporated there.</p>
      <p>On the completion of the edition by Professor Rapson and his colleagues, the documents were divided between this country and India. The originals of Nos. 213–427 and 510–565 are now lodged in the British Museum, and the rest are in Delhi. Apart from photographs, therefore, I have only seen the originals of the numbers mentioned above. Corrections in the notes in these documents are based on an examination of the originals. In the case of the rest, where photographs, as in the majority of cases, are not available, they are either based on alternatives suggested by editors themselves or conjectural. The lack of access to the originals is a handicap in the first two hundred documents. Later, in the second and third volumes, when the editors were more sure of themselves it is not so serious.</p>
      <p>Documents containing only lists of names, and those too fragmentary to translate, are omitted.</p>

            <br>
            
              This receipt concerning land of the monk Yipiya is to be carefully kept
                            by the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span> Ramṣotsa.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Jeyabhatra, the <span class="bibit">camkura [. . .]</span> and
                            the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka.<br>
              In the 20th year, 4th month, 22nd day of
                            the reign of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Aṃǵoka, son of heaven,
                            there is a monk called Yipiya resident in Caḍ́ota. He arose and sold
                            land to the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Ramṣotsa (consisting of) twenty-five
                                <span class="bibit">kuthala</span> in the <span class="bibit">miṣi</span>-land. Formerly this
                            land was <span class="bibit">miṣi</span> but after that this land fell
                                <span class="bibit">akri</span>. From the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Ramṣotsa the monk
                            Yipiya received as price of the land three horses (?) valued at fifteen.
                            This was received by Yipiya. They agreed on equal terms. From now on in
                            that land Ramṣotsa has ownership, to sow, to plough, to give as a gift
                            to another, to exchange, to do whatever he likes with it. Witnesses to
                            this are the community of monks at Caḍ́ota, the magistrates
                            administering the kingdom <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> V́arpa and
                                <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Karaṃtsa, the <span class="bibit">v́asus</span> Acuñiya and
                            Caḍhi, the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> of Calmadana Suryamitra, Kuraǵeya, and
                            Vukiṃna. Whoever at a future time informs, disputes, or disagrees about
                            this land, his bringing up again of the matter shall be without
                            authority at the king's court. This document was written by me the
                            scribe Moǵata, son of the scribe Tamasṕa, at the command of the
                            magistrates. Its authority is as long as life. It was written at the
                            request of the monk Yipiya.<br>
              The <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Caḍhi cut the string.<br>
              (Postscript.) In the 4th year, 2nd month, 28th day in
                            the reign of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mahiriya, son of heaven,
                            the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Jeyabhatra, the <span class="bibit">caṃkura</span> Cataraǵa, the
                                <span class="bibit">cuv́́alaina</span> Tiraph́ara, and the <span class="bibit">cozbos</span>
                            Soṃjaka and Vanaṃta examined a dispute (on this matter) in Caḍ́ota. This
                            field was sown by an act of force. Now the V́asu Vuǵica and the scribe
                            Ramaṣtso have brought an action. This written tablet (<span class="bibit">ṣulǵa
                                lihidaǵa</span>) was the authority. A quarter of the seed is to be
                            taken as his own by V́uǵica, the rest of the corn and the land is to be
                            taken by Ramaṣtso.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: U.O. (3). Professor Thomas (<span class="bibit">Act. Or.</span>, xi, p. 38) takes the phrase <span class="bibit">akri patida</span> to mean "fell out of cultivation". There is, however, hardly enough evidence to decide the exact meanings of the terms <span class="bibit">akri</span> and <span class="bibit">miṣi</span>.<br>
              U.O. (4) <span class="bibit">re ka s̱o [te]</span> is quite obscure.<br>
              C.R. (6). The word <span class="bibit">ṣulǵa</span> is apparently another form of the word usually appearing as <span class="bibit">ṣilýoǵa</span>.<br>

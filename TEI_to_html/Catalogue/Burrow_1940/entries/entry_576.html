              This document concerning twenty <span class="bibit">muli</span> and nine sheep
                            (received) from the <span class="bibit">caru</span> Ciniǵa and Platǵa is to be
                            carefully kept by the scribe Sunaṃta and Caṣǵeya.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">cozbos</span> Yitaka and Vukto.<br>
              In the 21st year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mayiri, son of heaven, in the 12th month,
                            23rd day, in this reign, the <span class="bibit">caru</span> Ciniǵa and Platǵa had a
                            dispute with the scribe Sunaṃta and Caṣǵeya. An oath was to be sworn by
                            Suḡ́uta, the scribe Sunaṃta, Kuñita, and Caṣǵeya. Ciniǵa and Platǵa
                            stopped them from taking the oath. They voluntarily admitted their debt.
                            They placed a sum of twenty in the hand of the <span class="bibit">caru</span> Kunǵeya
                            and Oǵala. In addition nine sheep are to be paid by Ciniǵa and Platǵa
                            and received by Caṣǵeya. Witnesses to this are (of the) nobles, the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Namarasma, the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Keniǵa, the
                            attendant on the King, Lýimsu and the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Lýipeya. It
                            was written at the command of the <span class="bibit">cozbos</span> Yitaka and Vukto
                            by me the scribe Socara. It has authority in all places.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . . Saṃghila submits that he is about to go on a
                            mission to Khotan. One express horse was to be given him there from the
                            state. You did not provide a horse from the state (but) Saṃghila
                            received a horse for hire. The cost of hire ought to have been provided
                            there from the state. The <span class="bibit">cozbo Ṣamas̱ena</span> was security.
                            When this sealed wedge-tablet reached you, forthwith thereupon you must
                            carefully inquire with oath and witness, whether it is really so and
                            however much the cost of hire was decided to be, (so much) must be
                            collected by Larsu and sent here. A decision is to be made according to
                            the Law of the kingdom, etc. . . .<br>

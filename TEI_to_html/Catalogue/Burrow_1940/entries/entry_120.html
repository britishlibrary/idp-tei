                            go to the <span class="bibit">ṣitǵa potǵe</span> for the second time. All the
                            work-people came to the bridge [. . . ] the water was very muddy
                                (<span class="bibit">kha[lu]ṣa</span>). Owing to that fault the well-born people
                            came to an agreement. We stopped and turned back the magistrates from
                            the <span class="bibit">ṣitǵa potǵe</span>. The well-born people who were there on
                            account of the king's business were: Namarazma, the senior

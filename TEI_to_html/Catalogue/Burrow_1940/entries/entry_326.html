              . . . ] and Picǵa complained concerning the house and farm and land of
                            Kam̄aya. The <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Vuǵaca and the <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Yipicǵa
                            [. . . . ] the farm and house and land of Kam̄aya belongs to Tras̱a
                            Av́ana. On that point there were no witnesses. The <span class="bibit">cozbo</span>
                            Ṣamas̱ena made a representation (saying): The farm and house of Kam̄aya
                            is our inherited property. There many old people of Caḍ́ota came out as
                            witnesses. Considering that the house and farm and land of Kam̄aya is
                            the inherited property of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena, we have
                            decided that this house and farm and land, along with everything on it
                            belongs to the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena. There shall be no payments
                            or receipts on the part of the people of Tras̱a Av́ana, the matter has
                            been cleared, a decision has been made.<br>

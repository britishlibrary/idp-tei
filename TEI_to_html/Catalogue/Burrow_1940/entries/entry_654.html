              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              In the 8th year, 8th month, 21st day of the reign of his majesty the
                            great king Aṃgoka, son of heaven, there is a man [. . .] called Micorca.
                            He arose and sold <span class="bibit">agri</span> land to Moǵata (with a capacity) of
                            three <span class="bibit">milima</span>. Micorca received as price one
                                <span class="bibit">vito</span> horse. They agreed on equal terms. In that land
                            Moǵata has ownership, to clear (?), to sow, to plough, to give to
                            another as a present, to do whatever he likes with. Whoever at a future
                            time finds fault with this, his bringing up again of the matter shall be
                            without authority at the king's court. Witnesses to this are the
                                <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> Piteya, the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Karaṃtsa, the
                                <span class="bibit">guśura</span> Acuñiya, the <span class="bibit">apsu [. . .]</span> Śaṃca,
                            the <span class="bibit">to(ṃ)gha</span> Kuv́aya, the <span class="bibit">śadavida</span> Moǵata [. . .] 
                            the scribe Moǵata, the scribe Apǵaya, and the <span class="bibit">aryaǵa</span>
                            Piteya. This deed was written by the scribe Ramṣotsa son of the scribe
                            Siǵnaya, at the command of the magistrates. Its authority is a thousand
                            years.<br>

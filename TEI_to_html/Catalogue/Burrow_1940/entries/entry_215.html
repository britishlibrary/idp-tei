                            dead young animals.<br>
              In the 4th year the <span class="bibit">apsu</span> Apñiya received one dead young
                            animal, Kiṃciya received one young animal. In the 5th year the three

              Note: An alternative reading for <span class="bibit">suśaǵa</span> is
                                <span class="bibit">vuryaǵa</span>, a term which occurs elsewhere.
                                <span class="bibit">Suśaǵa</span>, however, is also attested by the variant form
                                <span class="bibit">suj́aǵa</span> (387). If it is = Skt. <span class="bibit">sūcaka</span> it
                            might mean "informer".<br>

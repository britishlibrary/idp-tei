              In the 22nd year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mayiri, son of
                            heaven, in the first month and the 25th day, at this date the scribe
                            Ramṣotsa, Suḡ́uta, Sunaṃta, Kuñita, and Caṣǵeya arose and gave as a
                            present to the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka <span class="bibit">akri</span>-land of an
                            extent capable of receiving 2 <span class="bibit">khi</span> of seed of
                                <span class="bibit">aḍ́ini</span>, and some more land outside - the extent of both
                            together was (such as to receive) 5 <span class="bibit">khi</span> of
                                <span class="bibit">aḍ́ini</span>. The <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka arose and gave
                            as a gift to the scribe Ramṣotsa and Suḡ́uta as a return for the land
                            one rug (<span class="bibit">koj́ava</span>) worth 10 <span class="bibit">muli</span>. They agreed
                            on equal terms. From this day forth in that land the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span>
                            Soṃjaka has full power to sow, plough, give it in exchange and do
                            whatever he pleases with it.<br>

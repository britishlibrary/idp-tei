              His majesty, etc. . . . Just as formerly in Peta-avana there the year's
                            tax was assessed, last year's tax was put into the hand of the
                                <span class="bibit">suǵnutas</span>. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you,
                            forthwith the <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Lýipeya is to be questioned about this
                            tax, and it is to be quickly sent here all complete in the hand of the
                                <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Sa(ṃ)ǵapeya. Just as formerly from Peta-avana
                            there a camel was reckoned in the year's tax, and that camel should be
                            neither old nor thin, this camel is to be sent here with the
                            above-mentioned tax. If there are any arrears of tax, all must be sent
                            here. The tax consisting of ghee is to be sent on quickly
                            beforehand.<br>

              Note: <span class="bibit">Suḡ́uta</span> (<span class="bibit">Suḡ́uta</span>) usually appears as a
                            proper name. Here, in the genitive plural, it seems to indicate a class
                            of officials.<br>

              U.O. To his dear brother <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Lýipeya, etc. . . . the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Nastiṃta pays respect, etc. . . . and thus
                            (writes): (since) I went from there I have been in good health through
                            your favour [. . .]. Now I have sent some royal camels there. Among them
                            there is a three-year-old camel. This is to be again sent back to the
                            kingdom. There is a sealed wedge-tablet dealing with that matter. This
                            sealed wedge-tablet is to be read in the presence of Saǵamoya and then
                            given to Saǵamoya to keep. By all means let these people of my district
                                (<span class="bibit">kilme</span>) be under your care. I sent this letter while on
                            a journey, so do not worry about a gift. Also I have delivered these
                            camels over to this Sumata. From now on (this) <span class="bibit">acovina</span>
                            (Sumata) is to be removed from the <span class="bibit">aco</span>. Also there is said
                            to be a <span class="bibit">śramana</span> called Dharmapriya in Saluv́aae's house.
                            When this Sumata arrives there, orders must be given for handing over
                            this <span class="bibit">śramana</span> into the hands of Sumata. This
                                <span class="bibit">śramana</span> was a slave of Motǵe (son ?) of
                                <span class="bibit">bhari</span> Maṣḍhiǵe. A quarter of him was sold to me. We
                            have made a decision about everything. This <span class="bibit">śramana</span> shall
                            now belong to you. /<br>

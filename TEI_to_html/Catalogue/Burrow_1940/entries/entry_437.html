              This tablet (<span class="bibit">paṭi</span>) concerning a girl Saǵanāpaae (bought)
                            from Suḡ́i is to be carefully preserved by Maṣḍhiǵe.<br>
              [This is the seal] of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kapǵeya and the <span class="bibit">kitsayitsa</span> Luṭhu.
                            In the 34th year of his majesty Jiṭugha Aṃgoka, son of heaven, in the
                            2nd month, 12th day, in this reign, there is a man of Caḍ́ota, Koṃpala
                            belonging to the <span class="bibit">kilme</span> of the <span class="bibit">caṃkura</span> Kapǵeya
                            and his son Suḡ́i. These sold a girl five <span class="bibit">diṣṭis</span> tall to the monk
                            Budhasena and Maṣḍhiǵe. The value of that girl was reckoned at
                            forty-five <span class="bibit">muli</span>, and they made the agreement. So this Koṃpala and Suḡ́i
                            received one <span class="bibit">viyala</span> camel worth 42 <span class="bibit">muli</span>. The remaining 3 <span class="bibit">muli</span> was kept
                             back. Concerning this sum, these people, Suḡ́i and Maṣḍhiǵe, have now
                            complained in our presence. The <span class="bibit">caṃkura</span> Kapǵeya and the <span class="bibit">kitsayitsa</span> Luṭhu
                            examined (the dispute) and made a decision. So the <span class="bibit">caṃkura</span> has given
                            freedom with reference to that girl to sell her outright (<span class="bibit">muṣāya</span> (?));
                             so now that girl Saǵanāpaae has become the property of this Maṣḍhiǵe.
                            Even so as a remnant of the first price was kept back, so now that price
                            is to be received with one addition (<span class="bibit">eka ayoǵena</span>). The sum
                            (is now) five. (Payment of) anything else is prevented, and the total
                            amount (<span class="bibit">mull piṃḍa</span>) is to be paid by Maṣḍhiǵe — 5 <span class="bibit">muli</span> — and received by
                             Suḡ́i. From now on with respect to that girl Maṣḍhiǵe shall have
                            authority to do what he likes with her. He shall be master over her in
                            all matters. Whoever at a future time, whether he be brother of <span class="bibit">caṃkura</span>
                            Kapǵeya, or brother's son, or grandson, or relative, or any other
                            dependent (<span class="bibit">kilmeci</span>), shall again bring the question up
                            before the <span class="bibit">v́asus</span> and <span class="bibit">aǵetas</span> concerning that girl, and shall desire to
                            make it otherwise, his representations at the king's court shall be
                            without authority, and he shall pay the penalty which ensues (namely, a
                            fine of) one four-year-old gelding and fifty blows. All this penalty
                            shall be paid, and this shall remain as is written above. This was
                            written by me, the scribe Bhaṃmeca at the command of the <span class="bibit">caṃkura</span>.<br>

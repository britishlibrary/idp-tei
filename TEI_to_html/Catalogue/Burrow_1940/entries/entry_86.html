              To the <span class="bibit">caraǵa</span> Sucaṃma and the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Tǵaca, dear
                            to men and gods, respected and of pleasant aspect, the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span> Lýipeya sends the health of their divine
                            bodies, again and again, much, beyond measure, and thus (he says),
                            namely: We have made a time (for you to come and) do the royal business.
                            You do not want to come here. Certainly next morning the
                                <span class="bibit">śadavidas</span> and <span class="bibit">karsenav́as</span> and the (other)
                            officials whose names are mentioned in the list must come here.<br>
            <br>
          <br>
          <span class="notheader">Section: Rev.</span><br>
            
              . . . .to dear brother <span class="bibit">ṣothaṃgha cozbo</span> Lýipeya [. . .] pays
                            respect, etc. . . . and thus (says) namely: From there you sent Casmina
                            our agent [. . . . ] to get the register, but I do not know which
                            register is to be taken there [. . .]. There is every reason to fear (an
                            attack) from the Supis. In the city here (we) will make a review of the
                            people [. . .] we will go there. The Khotanese have come here. They are
                            looking for Paṃcina on account of (the matter of) the boundary.
                            Certainly Paṃcina must be sent here when the cock crows.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: Read probably (O 4) <span class="bibit">kārsenav́a</span> for
                                <span class="bibit">kārsenade</span>. The two classes of officials
                                (<span class="bibit">śadavida</span> and <span class="bibit">karsenav́a</span>) are usually
                            mentioned together.<br>
              Compare with <span class="bibit">kukuḍ́a [karya] mana</span>, <span class="bibit">kukuḍ́a
                                ǵ.[ḍa]ma[na]</span> in 525. Obviously it is the same word in both
                            places but in neither case can the writing be properly made out. We
                            should restore in all probability <span class="bibit">kukuḍ́a [kuj́a]</span> mana
                            meaning "when the cock crows" (Skt. <span class="bibit">kūj-</span>), i.e. early in
                            the morning. This is what the sense demands. Compare <span class="bibit">pratu</span>
                                (<span class="bibit">prātar</span>) above.<br>

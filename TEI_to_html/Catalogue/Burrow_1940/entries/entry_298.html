              In the 17th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭuṃgha Mairiya son of
                            heaven at this date in the 4th month, on the 17th day Caku, Moǵe, and
                            Aṣena made a lawsuit. Caku took it upon him to do the farm work, (while)
                            Aṣena and Moǵe undertake to make the complaint at the king's court.
                            Those ploughed fields of the farm which have been ploughed are to be
                            properly watered and looked after. Both the internal and external
                            cultivation is to be properly looked after.<br>

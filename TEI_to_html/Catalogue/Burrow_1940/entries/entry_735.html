            <br>
            
              [. . .] a man was put under the care of Opǵeya. NOW the people of
                            Suḡ́ita's household demand a man from Opǵeya. When this sealed
                            wedge-tablet reaches you, whether really with Aśi, of the Khotanese [. . .]
                            ( ? ) a fugitive has been received by Suḡ́ita. From there specifically
                            a fugitive is not to be given to Opǵeya. A fugitive is quickly to be
                            given to Opǵeya from among the other fugitives which there are. Opǵeya
                            will hand (him) over to Suḡ́ita.<br>
              In the 4th year, 2nd month, 7th day.<br>

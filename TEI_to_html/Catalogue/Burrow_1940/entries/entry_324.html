              In the 4th year of his majesty the great King Mairi the son of heaven, on
                            the 13th day of the 3rd month, at this date (?) the Supis came to
                            Calmadana; they plundered the kingdom and carried off the inhabitants.
                            The Supis seized a man called Saṃrpina, a slave of the <span class="bibit">vasu</span>
                            Yonu and sent him as a present to Cinaṣǵaṣi (the Chinaman Ṣǵaṣi).
                            Cinaṣǵaṣi (provided) from here, as a recompense for the man, two golden
                            staters and two drachmas. (Consequently) that man became the rightful
                            property (?) of Ṣǵaṣi. His own master, the <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Yonu, did
                            not wish to remove the man himself, and permission was given to Ṣǵaṣi to
                            sell him to others. Considering this Cinaṣǵaṣi sold this man to Katǵe.
                            As the price of the man [. . . ] and one bow is right. Cinaṣǵaṣi has
                            sold well and Katǵe has bought well. From now on [. . .]<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: Difficulties remaining are (2) <span class="bibit">mahap[o] . . . . bulena
                                kuṣena</span> and (5) <span class="bibit">na cimaǵa</span>. In both cases the

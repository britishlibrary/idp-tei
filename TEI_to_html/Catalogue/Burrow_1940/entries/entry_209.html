            <br>
            
              In the 3rd year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Vaṣmana, the
                            Devaputra, the 1st month, 12th day, at that time, at this date, there is
                            a man called Palǵe belonging to the <span class="bibit">kilme</span> of the ogu
                            Puṃñyasa and Jayaśa. He arose and they sold a woman called Argiyotǵisaae
                            to the <span class="bibit">rāsuvaṃta</span> Apta. Palǵe received as price of this
                            woman a camel seven years old. They agreed on equal terms. They made a
                            decision in front of witnesses. The penalty (for violating the
                            agreement) is similar (for both parties). They cut the string. They gave
                            the <span class="bibit">o[ḍ́u]vaǵa</span> of a
                                <span class="bibit">kapala</span> camel. On that point they agreed to a like
                            penalty. Whoever should want to alter this agreement at a future time,
                            they fixed a similar penalty (for each), (a fine of) one
                                <span class="bibit">vito</span> horse and seventy blows. The witnesses were the
                            monk Priyosa, Panaǵara (?), and Kviñaǵa. They made a settlement.<br>

              Note: The meaning of the words <span class="bibit">kapala</span> and <span class="bibit">o[ḍ́u]vaǵa</span> is obscure.<br>

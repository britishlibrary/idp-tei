              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              This document concerning Ṣamaṃnera adopted from the woman Tsinaae is to
                            be well kept by Kuñita.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span>
                            Soṃjaka. In the 13th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭuṃgha
                            Mahiriya, son of heaven, in the 2nd month, 10th day, in this reign,
                            there is a woman called Tsiṃnaae. (Her) young son Ṣamaṃnera by name was
                            adopted by Kuñita. The woman Tsimnaae arose and took Ṣamaṃnera away from
                            Kuñita. Now they have lodged a complaint. The <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka
                            and the detective Lýipta examined this dispute. Ṣamaṃnera belongs to
                            Kuñita as an adopted child. The whole milk-payment has been given. They
                            have made a decision. As milk-payment one <span class="bibit">aṃklatsa</span> camel
                            has been given. Witnesses to this are the <span class="bibit">v́asus</span> Opǵeya,
                            Kaḱeya, and Saluv́eya, the <span class="bibit">arivaǵa</span> Camaǵa, the
                                <span class="bibit">śadavida</span> Kapǵeya, Kaṃcǵeya of Parvata, the
                                <span class="bibit">vuryaǵa</span> Vuru, the girl Caǵu, and the
                            <span class="bibit">śadavida</span> Caneya. This Ṣamaṃnera who has been adopted is
                            not to be made a slave, nor sold nor pledged. He is to be treated as an
                            adopted person. This was written by me the scribe Tġaca, son of the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span> Luṭhu, at the command of the magistrates, and
                            at the request of Kuñita, the woman Tsiṃnaae, and the monk Budhila. Its
                            authority is a hundred years.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . The <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhamga</span> Sucaṃma and Sunaṃta have
                            lodged a complaint. The <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhamga</span> Sucaṃma reports that; "I
                            have heard from Śriste who said: 'It is a fact that my masters were the
                            royal <span class="bibit">surva toṃgas</span>. They however reaped a regular harvest
                            out of the royal mares. They sold them here and there. The father of
                            Sunaṃta arose and fed royal fodder to them. The fodder was (?). Through
                            that cause the mares died' so he says. The <span class="bibit">kala</span> Karaṃtsa
                            arose and made an award of three mares against Suḡ́uta. "There is a
                            hand-letter," he says. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you,
                            forthwith thereupon inquiry is to be made. If there is a hand-letter, in
                            such manner a decision is to be made. As regards what Śriste said about
                            the mares dying and the royal <span class="bibit">surva toṃgas</span> selling them
                            here and there, if there are witnesses on this point, they are to be
                            questioned on oath. A decision is to be made according to law. If there
                            are no other witnesses, then a letter of information is to be sent here,
                            and there will be a decision here.<br>

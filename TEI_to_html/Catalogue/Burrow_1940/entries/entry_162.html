                            thus (writes): From there you sent Pǵita here concerning the tax of the
                            people of Peta-avana. Last year Lepata took sheep for three years
                            (namely) eighteen. This year they have taken all the six sheep to the
                            capital. We have sent three <span class="bibit">khi</span> of ghee there. There are no
                            arrears of last year's ghee or of that for the year before. What arrears
                            there are, it is now the fifth year (since they were due). All has been
                            collected and received. At that time a decision about arrears of tax was
                            made by us. You commanded Suḡ́ita to go there — (but) now there is no
                            arrears of tax, (so) for that reason Suḡ́ita did not go there.<br>

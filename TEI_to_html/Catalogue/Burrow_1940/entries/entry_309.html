              His majesty, etc. . . . gives instructions to the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span>
                            Soṃjaka, as follows: The people who were in charge of the government
                            there before you, at that time they used to bring here 150
                                <span class="bibit">milima</span> of <span class="bibit">koyimaṃḍhina</span> corn. During the
                            time you have been in charge of the province, since then the corn has
                            not been brought. In winter there was a letter of command from here
                            (saying that) that corn was to be brought to Calmadana. You have not
                            sent it to Calmadana. When this wedge-tablet of command shall arrive
                            there, forthwith this <span class="bibit">koyimaṃḍhina</span> [corn . . . ] is not,
                            its equivalent in value (?) is to be purchased and sent here in the hand
                            of Lýipana. It must not be held back.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: The term <span class="bibit">śuka muli</span> is difficult. If it &lt; Skt.
                                <span class="bibit">śulka</span> it may be translated either (1) "tax" or (2)
                            purchase value. Since the usual word for tax is <span class="bibit">palýi</span> and
                            we do not elsewhere find <span class="bibit">śuka</span> used for it, the first
                            alternative is unlikely. If we take it as &lt; Skt. <span class="bibit">śulka</span>
                            in the second sense, it is probably a different word from the
                                <span class="bibit">śuka</span> which appears regularly as an epithet of
                                <span class="bibit">masu</span> "wine". The latter seems to have quite a different
                            sense (<span class="bibit">Language of Khar. Doc.</span>, index, s.v., <span class="bibit">śuka</span>). The term
                            occurs again in 59 where it should be read instead of <span class="bibit">śubha
                                muli</span>.<br>

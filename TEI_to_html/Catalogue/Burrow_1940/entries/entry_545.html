              His majesty, etc. . . Suḡ́iya reports that the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kaṃci
                            took a horse of his. In that matter Yitaka was (involved). No price was
                            given in return for this. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you,
                            forthwith careful inquiry must be made in your presence. If it is true
                            that the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kaṃci has taken his horse and given no price
                            in return [. . .] the horse is to be handed over to Suḡ́iya as his
                            property by Yitaka. Whatever dispute there is, a decision is to be made
                            according to the law. If you are not clear there, they are to be sent to
                            the king's court under custody and there will be a decision here.<br>
              Also he reports that Vusmeya took his bow, and has kept it from him up
                            till the present day. Careful inquiry is to be made there in your
                            presence. (If) it is true that he has taken the bow, that bow, along
                            with the hire of it is to be received by Suḡ́iya as his property.
                            Whatever dispute there is, a decision is to be made according to the
                            law.<br>

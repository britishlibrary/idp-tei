              His majesty, etc. . . . There people are going hunting. They are wounding
                            the horses and mares (so that they become) lame (and) cannot carry
                            (their burdens). It is not right that the horses and mares should be
                            wounded. They do not wound <span class="bibit">kisana</span> and <span class="bibit">s̱egani</span>.
                            When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you they are to be stopped from
                            that, so that they do not wound the mares and horses.<br>

              Note: The words <span class="bibit">kisana</span> and <span class="bibit">s̱egani</span> (if rightly separated) are completely obscure.<br>

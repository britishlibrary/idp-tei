              His majesty, etc. . . Suǵnuta reports that Kuv́aya received corn from him
                            here in the capital (to the extent of) three <span class="bibit">milima</span>. They
                            agreed on a <span class="bibit">putǵetsa</span> camel as the price. From that time
                            many years have elapsed and he has not given (the camel). When this
                            sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, forthwith careful inquiry is to be made
                            in your presence. If its really so, a camel is to be given after making
                            allowance for the years that have passed, or else the corn is to be
                            given (back) along with interest. A decision, etc. . . .<br>

              Note: In <span class="bibit">ciṃtidadavo</span>, <span class="bibit">dadavo</span> is to be taken as
                            a separate word. The phrase <span class="bibit">varṣaǵana</span> (or
                                <span class="bibit">-°grana</span>) <span class="bibit">ciṃti</span> is not quite clear, but the
                            general sense would be as translated above.<br>

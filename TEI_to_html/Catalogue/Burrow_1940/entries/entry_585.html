              One horn of a deer and one chowrie, cut with a weapon, cut with <span class="bibit">a

              At the feet of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka,
                                etc. . . . . Kulavardhana pays his respects, etc. . . . . and this
                            is his communication. By all means let the people of our district
                                (<span class="bibit">kilmeci</span>) be under your care. They are to be looked
                            upon as your own. Also there was a slave man belonging to our district
                            there called Aṃtǵiya. He arose and gave as ransom (<span class="bibit">lote</span>)
                            for his own life a man called Cimǵeya and six sheep. These were twelve
                            sheep. This affair does not please me. The man is alive. Now I have
                            commanded this Aṃtǵiya to be brought here. The proper ransom has not
                            been given. If there he gives the proper ransom (<span class="bibit">loteya</span>)
                            and <span class="bibit">mukeṣi</span>, Kalýotsa will make a written decision there.
                            Considering that wine was due to us there, we have paid two
                                <span class="bibit">milima</span> ten <span class="bibit">khi</span> of wine into the royal
                            account. Certainly instructions must be given there. No obstacles are to
                            be put in the way of the wine (being sent). Certainly they are to be
                            commanded to give it. As a token of remembrance one
                                <span class="bibit">lastuǵa</span> has been sent. Certainly let them be under
                            your care. They are to be looked upon as your own. Nowhere in Caḍ́ota
                            instead of him a man [. . . . . <br>

              . . . . . .]considering this he announces at the feet
                            of the master [. . . . .] on account of that matter certainly in your
                            divine knowledge [. . . . .] is to be settled. Dham̄priya [. . . . .] to the
                            master, dear to men and gods, the great <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> [. . . . .<br>

              To his dear friend of pleasant aspect, Caṣǵeya, the monk Dham̄apriya
                            sends health, again and again, much, immeasurable, and thus (I write),
                            namely: Two camels of mine, one a <span class="bibit">vyalýi</span> are to be taken
                            from the people of Vuǵeya's household. I received here in Calmadana a
                            female camel from the son of Vuǵeya. You were surety for it. I left the
                            female camel in your hand. Now I have sent there from here a man Yilaǵa
                            concerning this female camel. Certainly you must demand the camel from
                            Pleya there. It is to be handed over to the man Yilaǵa in presence of
                            the magistrates. That camel is to be taken there by the
                                <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Kolǵeya. No obstacles are to be made. No
                            slackness should be allowed. As regards Pleya's dispute, (when) he comes
                            here, we will complain in front of the <span class="bibit">ogu v́asu</span>
                            Bhiṃmas̱ena, and there will be a decision. Also I have given this camel
                            in exchange to Kolǵeya. A hand-letter (containing) the decision has been
                            written. I have taken one three years old male camel from Kolǵeya, and
                            handed it over to the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Bhiṃmas̱ena. By no means let it
                            be withheld from Kolǵeya there.<br>

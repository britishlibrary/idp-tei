              His majesty, etc. . . . We have been informed of everything from the
                            letter of information which you sent from there in the hand of the
                            letter-carrier Caḍhi. Also you inform us that two camels belonging to
                            the <span class="bibit">kala</span> Purnabala will not stay there but run away. These
                            camels are to be properly looked after there. Let them become fat. They
                            are not to be brought here in the autumn.<br>
              Also you inform us that a man belonging to Camaka of <span class="bibit">kala</span>
                            Purnabala is doing work there, and not other people; (and that) there
                            are neither written documents nor witnesses. That man is to be removed
                            in the name of the <span class="bibit">kala</span> Purnabala. If anyone disputes this,
                            they may complain at the king's court.<br>
              Also (with reference to your request to the effect that), "They who
                            commit crimes here should die here," we sent (the culprits) to you. (Of
                            these) it is heard that Viharavala is wasting and destroying the wine
                            and meat of his own tenants (<span class="bibit">kilmeciyana</span>) As daily
                            sustenance there is to be given to Viharavala, along with his son(s) and
                            retinue, from his own estate, flour (<span class="bibit">aṭa</span>) and meal
                                (<span class="bibit">sate</span>) (to the extent of) 4 <span class="bibit">vacari</span>. He is
                            to be kept under the conditions (prescribed) for criminals (in such a
                            way, namely that) he shall not be free either hand or foot and shall not
                            be <span class="bibit">balasta</span> Also they have sent from here to Sudarśana two
                            pots. These are to be allowed to be taken in to him. In the
                            (abovementioned) manner food is to be given him from his own estate
                                (<span class="bibit">kilme</span>) and in the same way he is to be kept well
                            guarded. Also there are two households there belonging to Sudarśana.
                            These people are to be made swear an oath, and no mere scandal is to be
                            talked from here or heard there. From time to time these people are to
                            be allowed to go in to Sudarśana.<br>
              Also many times a letter of command has gone from here, (telling you) to
                            give a fugitive man to the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span> Saluv́i. Up to the
                            present day you do not give (this). You play the procrastinator. You are
                            quickly to give him: if again you do not quickly give him, have a
                            care.<br>
              Sihadham̄a's son is promptly to be brought out himself as a novice (?)
                            the <span class="bibit">śramana</span> is to be given to others as a slave.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: This document has already been translated by Professor Thomas in
                            <span class="bibit">Acta Orientalia</span>, vol. viii (1935), p. 64. As will be seen the present
                            rendering differs in a large number of points from his.<br>
              (3) Professor Thomas takes <span class="bibit">śarataṃmi</span> with the preceding
                            sentence. That is hardly possible, because always in this language the
                            verb is at the end of the sentence.<br>
              (4) <span class="bibit">kam̄av́eti</span> here, as elsewhere, seems to mean "works"
                            rather than "causes to work". Compare No. 107 and <span class="bibit">L.Kh.D.</span>, § 104.<br>
              (5) Before <span class="bibit">iśeva</span> insert <span class="bibit">teṣa</span> in the text which
                            the editors have accidentally omitted. read <span class="bibit">suṭha viheḍ́eti
                                vinaj́eti divas̱i nisaǵa</span>. The first sentence ends at
                                <span class="bibit">vinaj́eti</span> "destroys". Viharavala although imprisoned
                            was living luxuriously at the expense of his tenants, and wasting their
                            substance. This is to be stopped. <span class="bibit">Divas̱i</span> is quite clearly
                            to be read and not <span class="bibit">dinas̱i</span>. These adjectival forms in
                                <span class="bibit">-i</span> can be made from any noun, and are treated in
                            <span class="bibit">L.Kh.D.</span>, § 75. <span class="bibit">Nisaǵa</span> is in all probability simply = Pali
                                <span class="bibit">nissaya</span>. That <span class="bibit">-ss</span> is intended here is
                            quite clear because single medial <span class="bibit">s</span> become <span class="bibit">s̱</span>
                            (voiced) in this dialect. In all the passages where <span class="bibit">nisaǵa</span>
                            occurs we find <span class="bibit">s</span>, not <span class="bibit">s̱</span>. That <span class="bibit">ǵ</span>
                            commonly represents <span class="bibit">y</span> is pointed out in <span class="bibit">L.Kh.D.</span>, § 16.
                            Naturally such a form cannot belong to this dialect. Since
                                <span class="bibit">nissaya</span> is well known as a specifically Buddhist term
                            meaning the fundamental requisites of life, the word is obviously
                            imported from that source.<br>
              <span class="bibit">Viharavala</span>, here as elsewhere, appears to be a proper
                            name.<br>
              (6) Read <span class="bibit">aṭa yaṃ ca satu</span>, as Professor Thomas points
                            out.<br>
              <span class="bibit">balasta</span> is an unknown word. Professor Thomas separates
                                <span class="bibit">ba lasta</span> and regards <span class="bibit">ba</span> as =
                                <span class="bibit">vā</span>. This is not possible as initial <span class="bibit">v</span> does
                            not become <span class="bibit">b</span> in this dialect.<br>
              <span class="bibit">kuḍ́a</span> would be the regular form in this Skt.
                                <span class="bibit">kuṭa</span>, and so it is taken, tentatively. by Professor
                            Rapson. Professor Thomas, however, regards it as equal to the common
                                <span class="bibit">kuḍ́aǵa</span>, and translates it as slaves ("boys"). There
                            is, however, no authority for this words appearing without the suffix
                                <span class="bibit">-ǵa</span>. Nor does it suit the generals sense of the passage
                            (as interpreted by me; Professor Thomas renders it differently).
                            Sudarśana is in prison. His friends have been sending him two pots (of
                            ghee, or something).<br>
              (9) <span class="bibit">khaṃnavaṭaǵesi</span>: "you play the procrastinator," as
                            interpreted by Professor Thomas (loc. cit.).<br>

              The son of the great king <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Puṃnyabala writes. He gives
                            instructions to the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Saǵamoya, (who) must become
                            acquainted with what I write. I have sent a letter two or three times
                            (telling you) that you had to come here, and up to the present day you
                            have not come. You are a man of little merit, a procrastinator. [. . .]
                            took [. . .]. Now I have sent Cǵito and Cakuv́ala there. You have to
                            provide six <span class="bibit">milima</span> of wine. Cǵito and Cakuv́ala have to go
                            with you to the mountain to make <span class="bibit">vaṣḍhiǵa</span>. Also the beasts
                            of burden, the <span class="bibit">manaǵa</span>,the clothing (?
                            <span class="bibit">chataǵa</span>), and <span class="bibit">vusma</span> which (are needed) there,
                            are to be provided by you. If you do not pay attention to this matter
                            have a care. When you return from the mountain with Cǵito, you must come
                            here with him. Of these Cǵito Cakuv́ala, and Meghima [. . .<br>

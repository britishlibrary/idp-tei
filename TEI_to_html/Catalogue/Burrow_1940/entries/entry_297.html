              His majesty, etc. . . . The <span class="bibit">vasu caṃkura</span> Cakvala reports
                            that Tsuǵeṣila, a native there of Yiruṃḍhina-av́ana is removing the
                                <span class="bibit">haṣǵa</span> When this wedge-tablet reaches you, forthwith the
                            matter is to be carefully examined there with sworn testimony, whether
                            it is really so. According to the former law the <span class="bibit">haṣǵa</span> is
                            to be sent here to the king's court.<br>

              B. (N., xv, 121)<br>
              . . .] In that matter Puǵo is a witness there. The <span class="bibit">ogu</span>
                            Purnaśa seized two camels of Camaka. Thus the magistrates decided here
                            at the king's court-that one camel from the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Cimola
                            and a second camel from the guards should be taken to Camaka. Up till
                            to-day they have not taken them. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches
                            you, forthwith you must make careful inquiries there in person and
                            according to the decision at the king's court these two camels are to be
                            delivered to Camaka. If again there should be any dispute, etc. . .

            <br>
            
              In the (24th) year of his majesty the great king Jiṭuṃga Aṃgoka, son of
                            heaven, in the first month, on the 10th day, at this date, his majesty
                            heard this dispute himself. The <span class="bibit">ogus</span> Purvayana, Rutraya,
                            and Cinas̱ena, the <span class="bibit">suv́eṭhas</span> Aṭhama, Śṕalýaya, and Las̱a, the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Daḍ́avala, the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Rutra, the
                                <span class="bibit">cuv́alayina</span> Onuǵi, the <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Bhuǵta, and
                            the <span class="bibit">cozbos</span> Alýaya and [Ji]vaśaṃm̄a judged it. Moǵe, Cimaka,
                            Opǵe, and Kalu brought the action, concerning a man Pǵi. (It was
                            alleged) that Pǵiya, a slave of Moǵe and Cimaka, had a fight
                                (<span class="bibit">kalihari</span>) with Ropǵeya the father of Opǵe. They struck
                            each other. Afterwards that Pǵiya, slave of Moǵeya and Cimaka, fled. He
                            is not alive, nor has he been seen dead. After that Opǵeya's father
                            Ropǵeya[. . .] they gave a boy to Moǵe and Cimaǵa, a man called Bhiyaǵa.
                            Now this man Bhiyaǵa [has fled ] at a later time no one was able to say
                            anything about the man Bhiyaǵa. After that this Pǵi turned out to be in
                            Khema. Moǵeya and Cimaǵa got him from therewith a price paid out of
                            their own property. He died with them. On account of him there is no
                            quarrel. There is a quarrel concerning camels. There has been a decision
                            about everything. These people have no claim to payment from one
                            another.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . . Lýimsu informs us that a female camel belongs to
                            them and Simaśriae in common. A man called Suḡ́ika and her daughter
                            Smaǵasae rode off on this camel from Simaśriae's farm and fled away. He
                            and his father went after them with the frontier-guards and brought this
                            camel back. (As a result) two parts of this camel belonged to these two,
                            the father and son, and two parts to the guards (for their services).
                            The two parts belonging to the frontier-guards, they gave to them.
                            Simaśriae is demanding her portion of it. This dispute, etc. . . .<br>

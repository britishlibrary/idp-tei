              Concerning land of Dham̄alada, to be kept by Lýipatǵa.<br>
              In the 34th year of his majesty the great king Aṃgoka, son of heaven, in the 2nd month, 13th
                            day, in this reign, there is a monk called Dham̄aladha. He sold land
                            (with a capacity) of one <span class="bibit">milima</span> to the scribe Lýipatǵa. He
                            received as price ten <span class="bibit">khi</span> of wine and three
                                <span class="bibit">aǵiṣḍha</span>. The matter was settled. From now on in that
                            land Lýipatýa has ownership in all respects. This agreement was written
                            by me Dhameca before the <span class="bibit">kitsatsa</span> Luṭhu at the request of
                            Dham̄aladha and Lýipatǵa. Its authority is as long as life.<br>

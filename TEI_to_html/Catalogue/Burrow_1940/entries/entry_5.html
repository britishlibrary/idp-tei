              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              His majesty, etc. . . .The son of this Lýipeya has gone as an envoy, and
                            this Lýipeya is due to stay with the herds in the autumn. When this
                            sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, you must look carefully into the
                            matter. Whoever has to stay (?) with the herds [ . . .], must come here
                            in the autumn. By no means must Lýipeya stay here with the herds in
                            autumn. In the 26th year, 2nd month, 21st day to the royal court in the
                            great city, Kuṣanas̱ena was brought [. . . .].<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: line 3 (U.O.) is obscure because not fully read. Either
                                <span class="bibit">thita[ǵa]</span> or <span class="bibit">thita[vo]</span> would be possible.
                                <span class="bibit">ghosa . .</span> is quite obscure.<br>
              In the last line the sentence is broken off. We might complete
                                <span class="bibit">anita[ṃti]</span>, translating "they brought Kuṣanas̱ena",
                            i.e. as a substitute for Lýipeya.<br>

              This document is written concerning the wine in Yave av́ana. The
                                <span class="bibit">śuki</span> wine of the people of Yave av́ana for three years
                            is to be separately measured out. Of the people of the <span class="bibit">apsu</span>
                            Śāca, and of all the people of Yave av́ana, the original
                                <span class="bibit">śuki</span> wine is 19 <span class="bibit">khi</span> (each). It has been
                            collected for two years. In the third year a letter came from the
                                <span class="bibit">vasu suveṣta</span> Mareǵa (to the effect that) this wine was
                            all to be sold for clothing and bedding (<span class="bibit">astaraṃna
                                vastaraṃnena</span>). Of this wine Parsu brought the price, one horse
                            five years old, and with that horse he received five <span class="bibit">khi</span> of
                            wine and two <span class="bibit">aǵiṣḍha</span>. Another second horse the
                                <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Sṕaga took from here to there, and the
                                <span class="bibit">suv́eṣta</span> Mareǵa received it. With the horse was one
                                <span class="bibit">koj́ava</span> and one <span class="bibit">aǵiṣḍha</span> A third horse I
                            send from the <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span> Śāja. The <span class="bibit">suv́eṣta</span> Mareǵa
                            received it. (It is) four years old. Along with that horse one
                                <span class="bibit">avale</span>, two <span class="bibit">koj́ava</span>, and also one
                                <span class="bibit">aǵiṣḍha</span> were sent there. The total is forty-four,
                            (also) one white <span class="bibit">koj́ava</span> These objects were all packed there
                            in the capital by the <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span> Śāja. In addition four
                                <span class="bibit">kavaj́i</span> made of felt and one <span class="bibit">raj́i</span> On
                            another occasion the queen came here. She asked for one golden stater.
                            There is no gold. Instead of it we gave carpet (<span class="bibit">tavastaǵa</span>)
                            thirteen hands long. Ṣeraka took it. Many people here know this matter
                            as witnesses. (Also) one <span class="bibit">artav́aśa</span>.<br>
            <br>

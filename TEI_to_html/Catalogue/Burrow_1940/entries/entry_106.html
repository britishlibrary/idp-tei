              To his dear son Lýipeya and Saṃgha, etc. . . . Lepata sends health, much,
                            immeasurable, and (says) thus: I told you to send a camel in the
                            meanwhile. From there you sent a camel of the <span class="bibit">ṣacis</span> (= ?).
                            Here it has wounded the hand of Caṃpǵe and made it lame. He cannot do
                            any work. You know what work was left undone when you went there; here
                            day by day there is royal business. Also there are three people there.
                            One of those, Suḡ́ita, is to be given two camels and sent here quickly.
                            When this letter arrives there, on that very day Suḡ́ita is to be sent
                            here quickly with two camels. Also you sold here a man Saṃghadham̄a to
                            Ṣaǵana. That man complained before the magistrate; thus he says "I am a
                            man belonging to the king, Lýipeya is selling me without just reason."
                            He is unwilling to do the work of Ṣaǵana. What the exact state of
                            affairs is about this man you must make out there. A letter from there
                            is to be put in the hand of Suḡ́ita. Do not neglect to do this. Quickly
                            Suḡ́ita must be sent with two camels.<br>

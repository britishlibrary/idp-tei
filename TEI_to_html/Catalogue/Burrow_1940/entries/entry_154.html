              (1) In the 29th year.<br>
              (2) Lýipeya's parcel was two <span class="bibit">milima</span> and ten
                            <span class="bibit">khi</span>; (also) three <span class="bibit">khi</span> of ghee.<br>
              A. (1) Namarasma's parcel was four <span class="bibit">milima</span> ten
                                <span class="bibit">khi</span>, etc., etc.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: Of the commodities mentioned in the list a number are still obscure.<br>
              <span class="bibit">oǵana</span> is some agricultural product measured in <span class="bibit">milima</span> and <span class="bibit">khi</span>.<br>
              <span class="bibit">aǵiṣǵa</span> should be read <span class="bibit">aǵiṣḍha</span> as suggested in the Inde Verborum (cf. also Lüders, <span class="bibit">Textilien im alten Turkestan</span>, p. 12). It is probably some kind of rug or blanket.<br>
              <span class="bibit">ṣoṣami</span> is something numbered, not measured, but there is no indication as to its meaning.<br>

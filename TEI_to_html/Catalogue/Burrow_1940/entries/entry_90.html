                            Taṃcǵe appeared concerning the land in Tsaga, Namatǵa and [. . .].

                                <span class="bibit">kuthala</span> in the <span class="bibit">miṣi</span>-land. I have heard it
                            from the mouth of <span class="bibit">kāya</span> Suḡ́iya. The tax-collector Kenika
                            and the scribe Tǵaca and Rutraya say, "We have heard from the mouth of
                            Suḡ́iya that beginning with (?) in a westerly direction [. . . .] from
                            the east side belongs to the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Kusaṃgha." Again Namatǵa
                            speaks thus [. . . .<br>

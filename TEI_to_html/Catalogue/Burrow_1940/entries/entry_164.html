            <br>
            
              To the masters, of pleasant aspect, honoured by men and gods, divinities
                            in person, (namely) to his dear father <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Lýipeya and to
                            his dear mother Sarpinae, and to Suḡ́ita, Sarvaśrṛe, Sarvatrata, and the
                                <span class="bibit">cuṭane</span> Kuḍ́e. Lýimsu pays respect at their feet and asks
                            after the health of their divine bodies, again and again, many hundreds
                            of thousands of crores (of times), infinitely; and first of all I am
                            pleased at this, that I have heard that good health attends you along
                            with the people round you; I am well here through your favour along with
                            my beasts and my people; and thus I say: Let my <span class="bibit">cuṭana</span> son
                            Kuḍ́e be expressly under the care of you, my father and mother. Also here
                            there has been no decision about my business. Bearing this in mind I
                            asked Layiṃmaka (?). As regards the business of my farm keenness is to
                            be applied, the stock of beasts is to be properly looked after, and they
                            are to be well supplied with food and drink. Also I have not received
                            even a small amount of provisions from there. Without fail provisions
                            are to be sent in the hand of letter-carriers. Also now here they are
                            worrying (me) a great deal about the administration of the tax of the
                            people of Peta-avana. Last year Paǵo did the <span class="bibit">pake</span> tax. Also
                            they are causing trouble concerning the tax of the
                                <span class="bibit">kilýigaṃcis</span>. If this letter arrives there, quickly the
                            legal amount of tax is to be sent here. Also as regards the other tax
                            from that province which they are asking me about -- the
                                <span class="bibit">samarena</span>, <span class="bibit">tsaṃghina</span> and
                                <span class="bibit">kvemaṃḍhina</span> tax, without fail it is to be quickly
                            collected and sent here. Also without fail Paǵo is to be sent here.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: <span class="bibit">cuṭane</span> (2 and 5) as an epithet of <span class="bibit">putra</span> "son", perhaps means "baby", since Kuḍ́e is the grandson in the family enumerated here.<br>
              The syntax of line 6 is far from clear and it has not been possible to translate it fully.<br>
              The word <span class="bibit">pake</span> is perhaps the same as the common <span class="bibit">paḱe</span>, occurring so often in account lists. If so <span class="bibit">paḱe</span> seems to be a variety of taxation. Or we might take <span class="bibit">paḱe</span> as more generally "parcel" and translate <span class="bibit">Paǵo pake palýi kiḍ́a</span>. Paǵo did the packing of the tax.<br>
              The term <span class="bibit">kilýagaṃci</span>, occurring only here is quite obscure. It may be derived from a place name. The terms <span class="bibit">samarena</span>, <span class="bibit">tsaṃghina</span>, and <span class="bibit">kvemaṃḍhina</span> occur fairly frequently as kinds of taxation. Their exact significance is unknown.<br>

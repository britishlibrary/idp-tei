              To the foot of the master, etc. . . . his dear father the great
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka, the scribe (<span class="bibit">divira</span>)
                            Naṃdas̱ena sends his respects and greetings, much, immeasurable. I am
                            pleased that you are well; I, too, am well here through your favour.
                            This is what I have to say: All is in your divine knowledge. Whichever
                            affairs you leave to me here, I receive them (?). We are sending all the
                            letter-carriers. Also by me there is to be received from the people
                            there, from the monk Saṃgaratha one <span class="bibit">arnavaj́i</span>, from Suyama
                            (one) felt (<span class="bibit">namata</span>), from <span class="bibit">cȧru</span> Jimoya one
                                <span class="bibit">namata</span>, from the <span class="bibit">mararara</span> Kuviñeya one
                                <span class="bibit">namata</span>. By all means command must expressly be given to
                            them, that they should send them here quickly. Also I inform you that
                                <span class="bibit">rotaṃna</span> (madder) is due (<span class="bibit">kicamaǵa</span>) to me
                            here. The <span class="bibit">rotaṃna</span> should be sent here in the hand of the
                            letter-carriers (<span class="bibit">leha[raǵa]na</span>). (It will be) possible to do
                            you a favour in return.<br>

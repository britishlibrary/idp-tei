              To be carefully preserved by Kilýaǵi.<br>
              This is the seal of Tsuǵeṣla.<br>
              This document is dated in the 4th month, 21st day. At that time Tsuǵeṣla
                            arose and sold a pot (<span class="bibit">kalaśa</span>) Kilýaǵi bought it and paid
                            the price (?). Tsugeṣla received it and a decision was made. In future
                            the one owes the other [nothing]. This has been written in the presence
                            of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena. It has been written by me the
                            scribe Budharac̄h́i and has authority for 100 years. Whoever at a future
                            time shall disturb this arrangement shall pay a penalty — all to the
                            Saṃgha — of twelve lengths of cloth.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: In U.O. 2 <span class="bibit">Kilýaǵi</span> should be read a second time
                            betweem <span class="bibit">krinita</span> and <span class="bibit">muli</span>. The phrase
                                <span class="bibit">cora aṃna rupa</span> is obscure.<br>
              For <span class="bibit">dharanaǵa</span> the original actually has
                                <span class="bibit">dhananaǵa</span> which must be a mistake. Further a negative
                            must be missing here and has been supplied in the translation in square
                            brackets.<br>
              <span class="bibit">dhaṃta</span> must be for <span class="bibit">daṃḍa</span>. The local speech did
                            not distinguish cerebrals and dentals, but it is unusual to find the
                            distinction neglected in writing.<br>

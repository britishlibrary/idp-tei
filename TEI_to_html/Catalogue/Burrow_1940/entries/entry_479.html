              His majesty, etc. . . . Yapǵu informs us that Śruṭhe received
                                <span class="bibit">tarvardha</span> from him. When this wedge and seal reach you,
                            the witnesses, his friends, are to be immediately examined in your
                            presence, whether it is really so. If Śruṭhe has received
                            <span class="bibit">tarvardha</span> from them, by whom the house of Śruṭhe has
                            been received, from him <span class="bibit">tarvardha</span> is to be taken by them.If
                            there is any dispute, etc. . . .<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: The word <span class="bibit">tarvardha</span> which occurs only here is obscure. Nor is the reading perfectly certain. See the notes in the edition.<br>

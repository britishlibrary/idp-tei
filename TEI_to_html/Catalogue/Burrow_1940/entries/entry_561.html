              His majesty, etc. . . Sunaṃda reports that concerning a theft, a dispute
                            was judged by the <span class="bibit">kitsayitsa</span> Luṭhu and the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kaṃci. An <span class="bibit">aṃklatsa</span> (camel), a
                                <span class="bibit">putǵetsa</span> (camel), and an <span class="bibit">odara</span> (camel)
                            were to betaken from the slave of Jimoya. A written document was made.
                            The <span class="bibit">putǵetsa</span> and <span class="bibit">odara</span> (camels) were kept back
                            there. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, forthwith careful
                            inquiry is to be made there. Just as the dispute was judged by the
                                <span class="bibit">kitsayitsa</span> Luṭhu and the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kaṃci, in
                            that manner a decision is to be made according to law. If there's any
                            other dispute, they are to be sent to the king's court.<br>

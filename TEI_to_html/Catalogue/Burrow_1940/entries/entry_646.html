              To his dear brother Vaṃmaśula, etc. . . . the monk Saṃgarac̄h́iya,
                            etc. . . and thus (he writes). There is a hand-letter in the possession
                            of Motaǵe, son of Moteka. Vaṃmaśula is to try and find out what return
                            there shall be for that letter. We are able (?) to take. Certainly you
                            should send that hand-letter here in the hand of Yitǵo. Certainly that
                            must be looked for again, so that we can come there alive. Certainly you
                            must send your advice here so that no one shall hear it. At the time we
                            come there [. . .<br>

              In C.R. 4 read probably <span class="bibit">vis̱arje ma</span> as two words. Here, as above in line 2, <span class="bibit">vis̱arje</span> is perhaps a shorter form of the optative (= <span class="bibit">visarjeḥ</span>), for the usual <span class="bibit">vis̱arjeyas̱i</span>.<br>

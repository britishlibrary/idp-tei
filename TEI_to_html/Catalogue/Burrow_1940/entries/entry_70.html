              His majesty, etc. . . . . Just as formerly four years' tax was kept back
                            in the possession of Maltsaya (so) four camels were kept back in the
                            possession of Vuǵaca. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, this
                            tax, however much has been kept back, is to be sent here in the hand of
                            Dhaci.<br>

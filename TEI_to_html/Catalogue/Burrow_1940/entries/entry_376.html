              . . . . . . . .] you have not sent a letter of information. A second
                            matter: the Khotanese made a cavalry attack in Remena, and carried off
                                (<span class="bibit">aǵasavida</span>) Namarazma the son of Namata. You remain
                            silent. A third matter: a letter with an ensign went (to you, telling
                            you) to get ready the <span class="bibit">tsakeṃci</span> people. You kept it quiet
                            and did not get the people ready. Suḡ́ita took the letter of command to
                            you. On the first day you read the letter, (and only) on the third day
                            did you send the people out to the bridge. The porters
                                (<span class="bibit">pṛṭhabhāriǵe</span>) [. . . . ] complain (that it is) used
                            up. A fourth matter: Formerly letter-carriers used to go each month,
                            (but) you withhold the letter-carriers. Opǵeya demanded a letter in
                            reply. On your account a letter is to go. For that reason I prevented
                            him. A letter of reply was not taken in hand. From this letter of mine
                            you can become informed in detail. Having read this letter, you must act
                            quickly.<br>

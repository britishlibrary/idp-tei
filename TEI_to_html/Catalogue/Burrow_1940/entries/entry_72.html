                                <span class="bibit">godhūma</span> in the language of the documents. Other forms
                            are <span class="bibit">goduma</span> and <span class="bibit">gohomi</span>. In the beginning of

                            name for lists of this kind (cf. 59). <span class="bibit">Pita</span> and
                                <span class="bibit">pitaǵa</span> ("drunk") means "was watered". In another place
                            (703) the causative <span class="bibit">payita</span> is used.<br>

              To the feet of their dear father Yapǵu, etc. . . . And thus I write. We
                            have all arrived here in health. The <span class="bibit">aṣ̄a</span> have not received
                            their wages. (It is) 1 <span class="bibit">milima</span> and 10 <span class="bibit">khi</span>.
                            (Also) the felt and cloth is to be sent. The sheep are to be sent.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: <span class="bibit">aṣ̄ana</span> is obscure and occurs nowhere else. We can take it either as one word or as <span class="bibit">aṣ̄a na</span>, <span class="bibit">na</span> being the negative. The latter is perhaps the most probable since the things mentioned at the end of the text have presumably to be sent for this purpose.<br>

              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              In the 7th year of his majesty the great king Ciṭuṃghi Mahiriya, son of
                            heaven, in the 11th month, 20th day in this reign, there is a man of
                            Saca called Señiṃma. He and Aralýi gave the daughter (of Aralýi) to
                            Caṣǵeya. The mother of this Aralýi was taken in marriage from Ajiyama
                            av́ana. So they brought that girl Mumtritsae there in exchange for (?
                                <span class="bibit">muṣḍhaṣi</span>) his mother. Further on behalf of that girl
                            Mutritsae Cateya and Cataraka took as price one camel and one horse. The
                            camel was three years old and the horse was <span class="bibit">tirṣa(?</span> three
                            years old). Therefore we have sent away that girl Mutritsae who belonged
                            to us. Now I Señima, Aralýi, and Oǵaca have given Mutritsae to Oǵaca as
                            his wife. We ask as <span class="bibit">yimila</span> (= ?) present nothing, not even
                            a hair. So from now on whatever relation or son of ours there is, they
                            are not to take possession of her. (This transaction was completed) with
                            witnesses in the presence of the magistrate <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka.
                            Witnesses to it are the <span class="bibit">kala cuv́alayiṃna vasu</span> Kolýis̱a and
                            Sucaṃma. This tablet (<span class="bibit">paṭi</span>) was written by the scribe
                            Lýipatǵa and its authority is a hundred years.<br>
            <br>

              This document concerning a man Pruṣḍhaya is to be carefully kept by
                            Lýipeya.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Rokitsi.<br>
              In the 15th year of his majesty the great king Jeṭugha Mayiri, son of heaven, in the
                            first month, 11th day, in this reign, Lýipeya and Bośarsa bought a
                            man called Pruṣḍhaya from the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Rokitsi. The
                            <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Rokitsi received as price one camel five years old
                            and one horse five years old, and further twenty-five <span class="bibit">atǵa</span>.
                            They agreed on equal terms. From now on Lýipeya has ownership of that
                            man, to sell him, to pledge him, to exchange him, to give him to others
                            as a present, to do whatever he likes with him. Whoever at a future time
                            informs or disputes about this, his bringing up again of the matter
                            shall be without authority at the king's court. Whoever at a future time
                            stirs up a dispute and wishes to make it otherwise, shall receive a
                            penalty (<span class="bibit">muǵesa</span>) of (a fine of) one castrated horse, and
                            fifty blows. Witnesses to this are Tsmaya, brother of the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span>, and the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Saluv́eya. This was
                            written by me Suḡ́aṃta, son of the scribe Ramṣotsa, at the request of the
                            <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Rokitsi.<br>

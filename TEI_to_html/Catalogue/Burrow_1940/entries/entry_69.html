                            immeasurable, and speaks as follows: You sent the monk Caǵus̱ena here
                            about the army people. It was inopportune for me to remove the people
                            from Bhoti-nagara. For that reason I sent Larsu and Taṃjaka there to see
                            what news [. . . . .] sent a man to say that the people were not to be
                            removed from the city.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . . Now I have sent the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Alýaya on a
                            mission to Khotan. For the sake of the affairs of your province I have
                            sent in the hand of the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Alýaya a horse as a present to
                            the King of Khotan. Provisions for this horse are to be given from Saca
                            and Caḍ́ota: from Saca 10 <span class="bibit">vacari</span> of meal, 10
                                <span class="bibit">vacari</span> of <span class="bibit">phalitaǵa</span>, and lucerne in two
                            sacks, as far as Remena; from Caḍ́ota 15 <span class="bibit">vacari</span> of meal, 15
                                <span class="bibit">vacari</span> of <span class="bibit">phalitaǵa</span>, and lucerne in three
                            sacks as far as Khema.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: Read <span class="bibit">dui goniyaṃmi aśpita yava remenaṃmi . . . . . . aśpista
                                tre goniyaṃmi 3 yava Kemaṃmi</span>. The word <span class="bibit">aśpista</span>
                            is Iranian meaning "lucerne". Cf. NP. <span class="bibit">aspist, supust</span>
                            (Steingass, <span class="bibit">Dict.</span>) "trefoil, clover", Pahlavi <span class="bibit">aspast</span> Pašto

              <span class="bibit">Phalitaǵa</span> is clearly some kind of horse food like
                                <span class="bibit">satu</span> "meal", and <span class="bibit">aśpista</span> "lucerne".<br>

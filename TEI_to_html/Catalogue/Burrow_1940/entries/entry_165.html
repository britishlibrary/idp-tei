              To <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kranaya and <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Lýipeya of
                            pleasant aspect, the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Kirtiśam̄a presents inquiries as to
                            health, again and again, many, immeasurable, and thus (writes), namely:
                            First of all I have sent from here a letter and a present in the hand of
                            Maǵena and Paǵo; from that you must become acquainted (with the state of
                            things). Also in Peta-avana the arrears of last year's tax and the tax
                            of this year is to be sent here all complete with those same people (?).
                            If you send it either earlier or later than then and it gets plundered
                            on the way, you, <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Lýipeya, will pay it from your
                            own farm, parcel for parcel. Also with the corn newly (harvested) from
                            the land, a large quantity of ghee is to be bought and sent here. The
                            tax of the <span class="bibit">veǵa kilme</span> women and corn newly harvested from
                            the land is to be sent here complete. Also a tax camel is to be sent
                            here along with it. Do not keep back the camel from the
                                <span class="bibit">toṃgas</span>. Concerning that camel a detailed letter of
                            instruction written with the king as witness went there. To you
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kranaya I write. You must pay attention to this
                            matter. This Lýipeya pays no attention to it. What affairs of yours
                            there shall be in the future, I shall be able to do them for you.
                            Whatever news there may be there of good or bad, a letter about it is to
                            be sent here in the hand of a letter-carrier. What news there is here
                            you will learn from Lýimsu.<br>

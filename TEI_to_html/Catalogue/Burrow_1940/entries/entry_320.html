                            pay (proper) attention to (my) cultivation, I am writing, now that I
                            have an opportunity, to you; and I request you to take thought
                            concerning this Ph́uv́as̱ena and let him go, so that he can take in hand
                            my ploughing and sowing. If even so you do not take compassion and let
                            him go, there is another man there called Sarpiǵa who is suitable. But
                            this <span class="bibit">pāǵanātsa</span> is to be written. By all means let
                            Ph́uv́as̱ena be freed and let go, I request you particularly. I have
                            brought this matter to your notice now that I have an opportunity, lest
                            there be an absence of opportunity in the future. I have sent this
                            letter of request and greeting from the <span class="bibit">rocakhora</span> of the
                                <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Jeyaśa, so you need not be angry about (the absence
                            of) a gift. Since you went away from here your house and family are all
                            well.<br>

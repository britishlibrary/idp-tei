              Also let the little child be under your care. Also some gold has been
                            left. When there is a suitable man there as messenger, it is to be sent
                            here in his hand. Whatever news you have there, let me know about it
                            here. He asks about the health of his dear brother Kunas̱ena, many
                            (times) beyond measure. Also I sent a small present earlier in the hand
                            of [Salu ?]ve.<br>

              Note: For <span class="bibit">cuṭanaǵa</span> see 164, note. The next word is possibly <span class="bibit">culaǵa</span>, in which case we have two more or less synonymous words.<br>
              In line 2 read of course <span class="bibit">gami syati</span> as two words. The term <span class="bibit">gami</span> occurs fairly frequently denoting a messenger or courier.<br>

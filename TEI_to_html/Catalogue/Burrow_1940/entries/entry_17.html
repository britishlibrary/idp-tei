              His majesty, etc. . . . Puǵo and Lýipe inform us that Kreya and Ṣulýita
                            had (some property) deposited in a hidden place. Dogs and foxes dug
                            there and brought it out into the open. It was on account of a
                                <span class="bibit">pothi</span> (made of) skin which had been deposited that they
                            dug there. Afterwards Maṣḍhiǵe and Pǵeya took from that little by
                            little, and they say that much has been lost there. They say that
                            Maṣḍhiǵe and Pǵeya have stolen it. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches
                            you, forthwith an oath is to be sworn by Maṣḍhiǵe and Pǵeya. However
                            much they have, they must pay back. No payment is to be made which is
                            too much (<span class="bibit">ajhi</span>) or illegal. Also a law is established here
                            that what is taken in time of war is regarded as cleared.<br>

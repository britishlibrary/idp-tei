              (764) His majesty, etc. . . . Opǵeya and Upas̱ena make a representation
                            here now. Opǵe reports: When my son Upas̱ena was born Lýimo adopted him,
                            and thus he (Lýimo) spoke: Whatever people there are depending on me,
                            many or few, among these Upas̱ena shall be as an eldest son. They shall
                            live in dependence on him. That Lýimo died [. . . ] slave people and the
                            [. . . ] people of the master upset the agreement. They do not obey (?)
                            this Upas̱ena. Considering this, of this family Opǵe [. . .<br>
              (31) . . . ] whatever Opǵe shall command the slaves concerning the
                            household duties, they must act according to his word, they must not
                            transgress. This Upas̱ena is to be regarded as an adopted son in that
                            family. Whatever law of the kingdom and what family (?) law the rest of
                            the Caḍ́otans observe, in such a way these people must act. Whoever have
                            doubts whether there is any ruling on that point, shall complain here in
                            our presence and there will be a decision. Also as regards the
                            transaction between Lýimo and Puǵo at the time the kingdom was tranquil,
                            they are now making trouble about that here. When the kingdom shall
                            (again) be tranquil, there will be a decision about this.<br>

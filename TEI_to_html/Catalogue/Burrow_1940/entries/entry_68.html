              His majesty, etc. . . . Naṃdasena reports that Catmaǵe and Kuaṃca ate one
                            parcel of corn belonging to him. They have gone there and are now at
                            Tsaǵa. When this sealed wedge-tablet, etc. . . . you must inquire
                            whether this is really the case. (If so) this corn along with an
                            additional amount is to be taken by Opǵe and Lýipe. If it is otherwise,
                            and if no decision is made about this dispute of theirs, they must be
                            sent here to the king's court and there will be a decision here. Also of
                            these people much <span class="bibit">paṃḱe</span> is to be made here in
                                <span class="bibit">uṣasa</span> (= ?). Certainly it must be sent here. If you do
                            not make a decision there, and do not send it here, have a care.<br>

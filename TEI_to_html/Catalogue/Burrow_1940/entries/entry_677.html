              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              In the [. . .] year of his majesty the great king Aṃgoka, son of heaven,
                            in the 7th month, 6th day, in this reign, the woman Kosenaya bought land
                            from Siǵayita by giving (land) in exchange (<span class="bibit">namanaǵa muliyena</span>).
                                (?) gave a present of land to Kosenaya. The total land
                            (carries) three <span class="bibit">milima</span> of seed <span class="bibit">jhuṭhi</span>. This
                            land has become the property of the woman Kosenaya. She is to exercise
                            authority over it in all matters. That land has neither
                                <span class="bibit">seni</span> nor <span class="bibit">nic̄iri</span> tax (<span class="bibit">harga</span>). [. . .] 
                            of Kosenae, we have made. Her sons do not properly approve
                            of the reckoning. [. . . . her] sons have no claim to possession in that
                            land. This Kosenaya has ownership of the land to plough, to sow [. . .]
                            to give as a present [. . .]. Witnesses there [. . .] and Sudraneya.
                            This was written by me the royal scribe, the monk [. . .] at the command
                            of [. . .] and at the request of the woman Kosenaya. Its authority is a
                            hundred years.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: <span class="bibit">yi staṃ svi na</span> is completely obscure, as later is <span class="bibit">yaṃ ca va re va ma. . . ne na</span>.<br>
              U.O. (4) <span class="bibit">seni . . . . harga</span> is apparently a tax claimed by the military authorities. <span class="bibit">nic̄iri</span> is derived by Professor Thomas from <span class="bibit">nac̄ira</span>, and in that case <span class="bibit">nic̄iri harga</span> would refer to some hunting rights.<br>
              In U.O. (5) read <span class="bibit">edaya putrana laṃce cita na āroceṃti</span>.<br>

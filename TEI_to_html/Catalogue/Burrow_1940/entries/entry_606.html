              His majesty, etc. . . The monk Ayila informs us that a woman called
                            Cadis̱aae burnt his yellow robe (<span class="bibit">kaṣara</span>). When this sealed
                            wedge-tablet reaches you, careful inquiry is to be made, and a decision
                            is to be made according to law. If it is otherwise, or you are not clear
                            there, these disputants are to be taken into custody and sent here to
                            the king's court, (where) there will be a decision.<br>

              Concerning food and drink (produced on) ploughed land and a vineyard
                            belonging to the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Muldeya, to be carefully kept by
                            Ramṣotsa.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Dham̄apala, the
                                <span class="bibit">kori</span> Muldeya, and the <span class="bibit">kitsatsa</span> Lustu.<br>
              In the 34th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭuṃgha Aṃgoka, son of
                            heaven, in the 2nd month, 24th day, in this reign, the <span class="bibit">kori</span>
                            Muldeya and Ramṣotsa made an agreement. Ramṣotsa bought land from the
                            slaves of Muldeya. This land was returned by Ramṣotsa and the price was
                            to be sent back, (namely) one <span class="bibit">milima</span> of wine
                                <span class="bibit">potǵoñena</span> and one <span class="bibit">vito</span> horse. (This) was
                            to be handed over by Muldeya and received by Ramṣotsa. Concerning this
                            the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Muldeya has now given permission to Ramṣotsa for
                            this year to dig up the vineyard and plough the land. However much food
                            and drink is produced in that land in the autumn (?) it shall be
                            produced for Ramṣotsa. (The price of) one <span class="bibit">milima</span> of wine
                                <span class="bibit">potǵoñena</span> and one <span class="bibit">vito</span> horse — by that
                            Ramṣotsa is to be paid off. From that land neither is corn as rent to be
                            demanded of Ramṣotsa by the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Muldeya, nor is Ramṣotsa
                            to ask of the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Muldeya (the price consisting of) one
                            <span class="bibit">milima</span> of wine <span class="bibit">potǵoñena</span> and one
                                <span class="bibit">vito</span> horse. In the autumn they will make an agreement
                            with each other and there will be a decision. If they do not agree on
                            the price, the <span class="bibit">raṭh́i</span> trees and the <span class="bibit">paṃni</span> are
                            to be taken from the vineyard by Ramṣotsa as his property, and his own
                            land is to be taken by the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Muldeya, just as formerly
                            it was <span class="bibit">kurora</span>. Witnesses to this are the <span class="bibit">ogu</span>
                            Dham̄apala, the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Muldeya, and the <span class="bibit">kitsatsa</span>
                            Lustu.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: U.O. (6) <span class="bibit">śaḍ́a taṃmi</span> is difficult. It may be (as suggested in <span class="bibit">L.Kh.D.</span>, § 18) a mistake for <span class="bibit">śarataṃmi</span>.<br>

              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              His maj esty, etc. . . . Bhimas̱ena informs us that they employed a camel
                            belonging to him to carry a load of <span class="bibit">kuv́ana</span> (-corn). It died
                            on the way and did not bring its burden here. When this wedge and seal
                            reach you, immediately careful inquiry is to be made. The traditional
                            law of the land is that of whomsoever a man or beast dies while in state
                            employment, it has to be reckoned (= paid out) from the administration.
                            So you must take this law of the land into consideration.<br>

              Also we have put the cultivation under the care of Kuraǵeya and
                            Cuvalayina. Whatever food and drink is produced from it there is to be
                            given to this Caṃja, and a document containing the reckoning sent to me.
                            Also of Kuṣaṃta (?) in the land Lýipana and Parvata sowed [. . . .] has
                            been put under your care. The corn from there is to be given to Caṃja.
                            The reckoning is to be sent to me. If the <span class="bibit">kilmecis</span> in

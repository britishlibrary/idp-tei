              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              In the 5th year, 7th month, 6th day of his majesty the great King
                            Aṃguv́a[ka . . . .], the <span class="bibit">guśura</span> Viharavala, the
                                [<span class="bibit">tuǵuj́a</span>] Kapuṃca, the <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Rahulatǵa and
                            the <span class="bibit">kitsa &lt; i &gt; tsa</span> Kuḍ́e (Kutre) [. . .]. Kuv́aya, Moǵata,
                            Cimola, and Lýimiṃna — belonging to these there is a farm [. . .] and
                            arable land and a vineyard inherited from their father and grandfather.
                            So now they have made an equal division of it all (including) the
                            detailed items of clothing, bedding, etc. A decision has therefore been
                            reached. Also this younger brother Cimola has beaten Kuv́aya and broken a
                            bone. Now Cimola has been punished. Seventy blows have been given him,
                            he is much cut up. The recompense has been made a man five
                                <span class="bibit">diṣṭis</span> high. So from now on the elder brother shall
                            beat the younger brother, and the father shall beat the son — so is an
                            end to be made to this matter. With reference (to this matter), this
                            (letter) has been written to the <span class="bibit">kitsa &lt; i &gt; tsa</span> Piteya.
                            Whoever of these brothers injures another, they are to be stopped. Also
                            the <span class="bibit">maravara</span> Lepaya has a dispute with Kuv́aya about a
                            camel. Kuv́aya shall come here.<br>

              1. Just as a man traveling on a journey rests here and there when
                            overcome with fatigue, so a man's possessions from time to time, having
                            rested, come back again.<br>
              2. First a man prospers, then he
                            languishes; first he is praised, then blamed; first he grieves, then
                            rejoices; first he gives, and afterwards he begs.<br>
              3. When a man
                            neither gives away (his wealth) through stinginess, nor enjoys it
                            properly, the pleasures that are thus lost torment his mind, just like
                            heaps of corn belonging to an avaricious man stored away in a granary,
                            when they are (accidentally) burnt in time of scarcity.<br>
              4. Alas the
                            life of the poor; and again alas the life of those rich people who have
                            not the sense to enjoy or distribute (their riches).<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: On this text see <span class="bibit">J.As.</span>, xii (1918), pp. 319–327. The
                            third verse presents difficulties of reading and interpretation; the
                            others are straightforward.<br>
              A parallel to the second verse is to be
                            found in <span class="bibit">Mahābhārata</span>, v, 36, 44 (Poona Edition):— <p><span class="bibit">punar naro mriyate jāyate ca</span>,<br><span class="bibit">punar naro hīyate vardhate punaḥ</span>,<br><span class="bibit">punar naro yācati yācyate ca</span>,<br><span class="bibit">punar naraḥ śocati śocyate punaḥ</span>.<br></p><br>

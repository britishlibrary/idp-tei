              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              His majesty, etc. . . . Suḡ́ita informs us that he paid a price for a
                            woman Suḡ́isae. The price was forty-one rolls of silk. When this sealed
                            wedge-tablet reaches you, forthwith you must carefully inquire in
                            person, whether she was really bought. A decision must be made according
                            to law. Against the law officials must not take possession of that
                            woman. If you are not clear about it there, there will be a decision
                            when they appear in our presence at the royal court.<br>

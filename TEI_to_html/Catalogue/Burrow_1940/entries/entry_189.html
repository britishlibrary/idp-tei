              His majesty, etc. . . . The <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Opǵeya makes a
                            representation to the effect that the other keepers of camels do not
                            provide attendants in Nina. Now they are asking for attendants from them
                            (i.e. Opǵe and his colleagues) When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches
                            you, forthwith you must make a careful personal inquiry into the matter,
                            and just as the other keepers of camels do not provide attendants in
                            Nina, likewise these people have not to provide them. But if the others
                            do provide them . . .<br>

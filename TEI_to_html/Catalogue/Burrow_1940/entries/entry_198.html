                            that formerly a camel, belonging to them was sent to (your) province to
                            feed. Now again a second camel has to be sent to the province. When this
                            sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, immediately thereupon, the two camels
                            which were sent from him [. . .] whichever one is fat, that is to be
                            sent here in the autumn. That camel is to be handed over to the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga's</span> (taxation officials), they will bring it here.<br>

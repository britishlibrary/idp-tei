              His majesty, etc. . . . (3) Formerly from there (the tax) of
                                <span class="bibit">kuv́ana</span> corn was assessed at 350 <span class="bibit">milima</span>.
                            The <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Porkota has been sent there on the understanding
                            that they will bring one-(third) part of it into the capital. When this
                            letter of command reaches you, forthwith that corn is quickly to be
                            collected. Forty camels are to be given loads of three
                                <span class="bibit">milima</span> each (each load consisting) of two parts
                                <span class="bibit">juṭhi</span> and one part <span class="bibit">sahini</span> (The remaining)
                            two-thirds are to be deposited at Pisali. Fifteen camels whichever are
                            ready first are to be taken out to (transport) the wine. These camels
                            are to be taken from the military people.<br>

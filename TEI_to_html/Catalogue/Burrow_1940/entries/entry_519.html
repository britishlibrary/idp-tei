              To his dear brothers, etc. . . Cinas̱ena, etc. . . and thus I write. I
                            have sent a letter five or six times concerning sheep, but have not
                            heard anything from there. It is now the third year since I came there
                            and handed over to you, Caṣǵeya, and Pǵu eight sheep with lamb and six
                            males to dispatch here. After that the <span class="bibit">vulutsukla</span> brought
                            ten items of small livestock here. They were all goats. That left four
                            over. The other wretched animals you kept back there. These animals
                            along with those belonging to the <span class="bibit">kilme</span> are to be brought
                            here to Calmadana attended by Sucama. I am writing expressly. I will be
                            able to do something for you. Goats are not to be sent again. Also your
                            father Suḡ́uta promised, in your presence, a camel and a horse. Let it
                            not be forgotten. Also there are many people there [. . .]<br>

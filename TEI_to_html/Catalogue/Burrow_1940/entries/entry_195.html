            <br>
            
              In the 15th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mahiriya, son of
                            heaven, in the month of the new year, on the 20th day, there are some
                            people of Bhaǵasa, brothers (and sisters), (namely) — the
                                <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Opǵeya, Suḡ́iya, the <span class="bibit">apsu</span> Vuru,
                            Kuleya, Vuruv́is̱aae and Kutaǵa; they have made a sacrifice. They have
                            taken one <span class="bibit">aṃklatsa</span> camel from the <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Opǵeya
                            to the sacrifice. If this camel dies or is lost, or an armed band
                            carries it off, these brothers shall restore one camel of equal value to
                            Opǵeya.<br>

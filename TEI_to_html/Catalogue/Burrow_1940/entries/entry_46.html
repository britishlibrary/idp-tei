              His majesty, etc. . . .The <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Lýipeya (?) reports that
                            there the magistrates of the king's court examined a dispute. (They
                            decided that) the woman Konuma belonged to Peta-avana. Later you are
                            treating this dispute differently; you make the woman belong to
                            Catis̱a-deviyae-av́ana. When this wedge-tablet, etc. . .you must
                            investigate. According to the previous decision of the royal court you
                            must hand over the woman Konuma to the <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Lýipeya.
                            Whoever disputes this must be sent to the royal court and there will be
                            a decision here. Also he reports that men of Peta-avana are not
                            performing the public duties in the "hundred" of Koñita and Maṣḍhiǵa.
                            The former custom has been that men perform the public duties in the
                            hundred and that women do not perform the public duties of the district
                                (<span class="bibit">kilmi</span>). Of the women two <span class="bibit">korno</span> (= ?)
                            daughters must be handed over to the <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Lýipeya. Whoever
                            disagrees, at the king's court [. . .<br>

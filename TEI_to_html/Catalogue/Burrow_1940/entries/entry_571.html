              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              This receipt (<span class="bibit">pravaṃnaǵa</span>) concerning <span class="bibit">miṣi</span>
                            received from Koñaya is to be carefully kept by the scribe Ramṣotsa.<br>
              In the 15th year of the reign of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha
                            Aṃguvaka, son of heaven, in the 12th month, 8th day, there is a man
                            called Koñaya. He sold <span class="bibit">miṣiya</span>-land along with trees to the scribe
                            Ramṣotsa. The price taken was one camel two years old priced at fifty.
                            Koñaya received it. Other <span class="bibit">atǵa muli</span> (supplementary payment)
                            received was ten <span class="bibit">khi</span> of wine. Koñaya received in all a
                            price of sixty from Ramṣotsa. In that land the capacity for seed is
                            three <span class="bibit">milimas juṭhi</span>. They agreed on equal terms. In that
                            <span class="bibit">miṣi</span>-land Ramṣotsa has ownership to plough, to sow, to give to another
                            as a present, to exchange, to do anything he likes with it. Whoever at a
                            future time shall bring the matter up before the <span class="bibit">vasus</span> and
                                <span class="bibit">aǵetas</span>, his bringing up again of the matter shall be
                            without authority at the king's court. So they agreed in front of the
                            magistrates. Witnesses to this are the <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> V́arpa, the
                                <span class="bibit">kala</span> Karaṃtsa, the <span class="bibit">kuhaneci cozbo</span>
                            Kuviñeya, the <span class="bibit">v́asus</span> Acuñiya, Caḍhiya, and V́apika, the
                                <span class="bibit">apsus</span> Śāṃcā and Pitǵa, the <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span>
                            Karaṃtsa, Taṃcǵo, the <span class="bibit">aǵetas</span> Lýipatǵa, Kuuna, and
                            Kuviñeya, and the <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Kuviñeya. Whoever shall bring up
                            the matter a second time shall receive a fine of one gelding and seventy
                            strokes. This receipt has been written by me the scribe Moǵata, son of
                            the scribe Tamasṕa, at the command of the magistrates. Its authority is
                            a hundred years, as long as life. It was written at the request of
                            Koñaya. The <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span> Śāṃcā by name cut the string.<br>

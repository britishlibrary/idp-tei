              His majesty, etc. . . . Whenever a camel of the royal herds becomes weak
                            and is unable to travel it is to be looked after in that same province.
                            If [. . . ] it dies as a result of its load the keeper will owe for it.
                            If on the other hand it dies a natural death its <span class="bibit">paṃcare</span> is
                            to be delivered in that same province.<br>

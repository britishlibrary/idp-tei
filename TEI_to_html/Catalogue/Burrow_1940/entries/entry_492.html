              His majesty, etc. . . . The monk Moc̄h́as̱ena informs us that Samājhā
                            pledged a woman of theirs, Camavati, with Yonǵe. Samājhā died [. . . . ]
                            they produce a written document. It is not lawful to sell the property
                            of a master without asking his permission. (The question) must be
                            examined with oath and witness according to the king's law. If you are
                            not clear there, only the testimony and oath are to be written in a
                            letter and the document is to be sent here in the hand (of a suitable
                            person).<br>
              Such is not the law (that) a document is to be written without
                            the master (?).<br>

              Note: The last line is difficult, <span class="bibit">yena</span> does not seem to make sense. An alternative reading proposed is <span class="bibit">vina</span>, which has been taken for translation. On the other hand <span class="bibit">vina</span> "without" does not appear elsewhere in the documents.<br>

              Thousands of jars of ghee and hundreds of jars of oil are not worth a
                            sixteenth of one piece of meat in my opinion.<br>
              (If) he is liked by
                            women, nothing pleasant results from that. Women are like the edge of
                            razor. Who would speak praise of them.<br>

              This earth is no burden to me, nor Sumeru and the mountains. An
                            ungrateful man is a burden to me, one who has no gratitude.<br>
              I have
                            a desire for knowledge of grammar, music, the happenings on earth and in
                            the air, astronomy, the writing of poetry, dancing (?), and painting, to
                            which the world is attached.<br>

                                <span class="bibit">tāṇḍava</span> "dancing". The <span class="bibit">-l-</span> would be due to
                            confusion with <span class="bibit">tāla</span> meaning the beat or time of music and

              His majesty, etc. . . Lýimiṃna complains that without just cause Saǵapeya
                            and Pǵo take from him a <span class="bibit">v́es̱i</span> woman called Caṃtaṃnoae, and
                            also have intercourse with herby force. Two or three times a sealed
                            wedge-tablet has gone from here about that matter. Up till now you have
                            made no decision. This certainly is not right. When this sealed
                            wedge-tablet, etc. . . that woman Caṃtaṃnoae is to be handed over to
                            Lýimiṃna as his own property. Whatever he owes to Saǵapeya and Pǵo is to
                            be asked of him. If it is otherwise, etc. . .<br>

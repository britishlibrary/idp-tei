              His majesty, etc. . . . The <span class="bibit">suv́eṭha</span> Bhimas̱ena makes a
                            representation that the sister of Yapǵu who is <span class="bibit">kilmeci</span> in
                            Yav́e av́ana was taken as wife by the <span class="bibit">śramaṃna</span> Saṃgapala,
                                <span class="bibit">kilmeci</span> in Catis̱a devi avana. Neither
                                <span class="bibit">mukeṣi</span> nor <span class="bibit">lote</span> have been taken. When this
                            wedge and seal reach you, careful inquiry must be made. If she was taken
                            in lawful wedlock, (the inheritance) is to be divided in equal portions
                            between her sons and daughters. If, however, he has not made
                                <span class="bibit">mukeṣi</span> and <span class="bibit">lote</span>, there will be a decision
                            here.<br>

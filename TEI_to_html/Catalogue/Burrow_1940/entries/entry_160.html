              To dear brother <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Lýipeya, etc. . . . the
                                <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Kunala and Sunaka, etc. . . . thus (write): From
                            there you sent Catona here concerning the water and seed, to do the
                            cultivation. I have read the wedge-tablet here. In this wedge-tablet
                            there is no mention of water and seed. The old people speak thus: The
                            use of a farm was given to the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Lýipeya in Saca, water
                            and seed were not given. According as how the field was received from
                            the feet of his majesty, in such wise it belongs to you. Whatever
                            hand-(written) letter there may be there concerning water and seed, or
                            if there is a letter of command with a detailed account, it is to be
                            looked for and sent here. If there is no such (document) there, the
                            price of the water and seed is to be sent from there and the cultivation
                            will take place here. Also the old people say thus: When Sarpika was
                            settled here he used to provide the land, the people of Saca provided
                            the seed and water, and the <span class="bibit">katmas</span> did the cultivation.<br>

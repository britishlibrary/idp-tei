              To the masters, etc. . . . <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Lýipeya pays respect,
                            etc. . . . and thus (writes): My wife who was ill here is alive through
                            your favour. Also I have heard that you have kept blocked up the water
                            there, and am very pleased. Also you wrote here about some people. The
                            people will be taken there. Also there has been a / sacrifice of a cow
                            at the bridge to the god Bhatro. The <span class="bibit">ari</span> Kunǵeya says: " I
                            saw a dream; that sacrifice of a cow at the bridge was not accepted by
                            the god." So the <span class="bibit">ari</span> Kunǵeya says. In
                                <span class="bibit">nanaṃciya</span> Opiṃta's cow enclosure there is a
                                <span class="bibit">vito</span> cow. He asks for that <span class="bibit">vito</span> cow to
                            make a sacrifice to the god Bhatro; so says the <span class="bibit">ari</span>
                            Kunǵeya. This sacrifice is to be made at the farm of <span class="bibit">ekhara</span>
                            Motǵeya. Let no slackness be allowed in the matter of this cow. The
                                <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Lýimsu is to be quickly sent; along with the
                                <span class="bibit">ari</span> Calaṃma he will bring the cow. It is not to be
                            withheld. Again the <span class="bibit">ari</span> Kunǵeya saw a dream about a
                                <span class="bibit">pursa</span> sheep from the three <span class="bibit">apsus</span> to make a
                            sacrifice in Buṃni and S̱am̄ana (?). Quickly in that matter zeal is to be
                            applied.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: <span class="bibit">tutahu</span> (2) is obviously a mistake of the scribe for <span class="bibit">tumahu</span>.<br>
              <span class="bibit">śato</span> (4) (5) should be read <span class="bibit">vito</span>, a term applied frequently to various domestic animals. Its exact meaning is unknown.<br>
              It is by no means certain that <span class="bibit">buṃni-</span> (also <span class="bibit">puṃni</span>) is a place name. <span class="bibit">[s̱a]manaṃmi</span> occurs only here and nothing is known about it.<br>

              Concerning the son of Tsina, a novice, and an adopted child, to be
                            carefully preserved by Śim̄ema. In the 7th year of his majesty Ciṭughi
                            Mahiriya the son of heaven, in the 3rd month, 5th day, at this date.
                            When the Khotanese plundered the kingdom of Caḍ́ota, at that time three
                            young men of Khotan carried off the woman Tsinae. They came and gave her
                            as a present to the mother of <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka in the house of
                            the <span class="bibit">kitsayitsa</span> Luṭhu. They gave that woman Tsinae along
                            with her sons and daughters. (?) That woman Tsina gave her son, a
                            novice, five <span class="bibit">diṣṭis</span> high, as an adopted child to the man
                            Kacana. As milk-payment a <span class="bibit">vito</span> horse was given. This
                            (transaction was made) in the presence of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span>
                            Soṃjaka. Other witnesses know about it (namely): the monk Parvati, the
                            scribe Budharac̄h́ida, the <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Kolýis̱a, the son of a good
                            family Lpatǵa, the monk Vyarivala, Priyavada, and Caṣǵeya. This was
                            written at the request of that woman Tsinae. It was written by me the
                            scribe Lýipatǵa at the command of the magistrate. It has authority for a
                            hundred years.<br>

              (5) The passage <span class="bibit">khotaniye....uthida</span> remains hardly intelligible,
                            and therefore has been left untranslated. <br>

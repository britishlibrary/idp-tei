              At the feet of the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span> Lýipeya dear to men and gods,
                            glorified with a good name, by whom the road to heaven is adorned, the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbos</span> Kolýis̱a and Kunala (pay) respect and ask after
                            (his) good health, again and again, much, immeasurable, and thus they
                            say: From there, from our farm you put a man to work here. He is now
                            working here. But it is heard that the <span class="bibit">suḍ́e</span> (= ?) officials
                            claim him there again in the <span class="bibit">ayaǵa</span> works.<br>

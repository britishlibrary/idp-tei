              His majesty, etc. . . . Ṣameka informs us that he went as an envoy to
                            Khotan. From Calmadana they gave him a guard and he went as far as Saca.
                            From Saca they gave him a guard and he went as far as Nina. From Nina to
                            Khotan a guard should have been provided from Caḍ́ota. As far as Khotan
                            [. . .]. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, the hire of a guard
                            from Nina to Khotan is to be handed over according as it was formerly
                            paid, along with an extra sum. A decision is to be made according to the
                            law.<br>

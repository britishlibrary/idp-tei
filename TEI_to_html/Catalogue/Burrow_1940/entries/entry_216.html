              The Khotanī Preṣāṃḍha fled from the hand of Aṃti and went away. Now
                            Ḍhraka [. . . . .] took there. He (?) with Kilýaǵi concerning this man.
                            Here we the great [king] have investigated the matter with sworn
                            testimony. Lýipta and other people - the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Mutreya and
                            the [<span class="bibit">śada</span>]<span class="bibit">vida</span> Kunǵeya, have sworn an oath;
                            thus they said. That man, Preṣāṃḍha the Khotanī [fled] from the farm of
                            Aṃti; unjustly does Ḍhraka (?) with Kilýaǵi. For that reason the master
                            [. . . . .] at the [king's] court, the <span class="bibit">guśuras</span> and (other)
                            high officials must consider the matter in full detail.<br>

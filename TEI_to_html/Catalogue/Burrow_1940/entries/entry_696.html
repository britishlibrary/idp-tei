              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              Vasudeva pays his respects at the feet of the master, his dear father the
                            great <span class="bibit">guśura</span> Bhatiǵa, and asks after the health of his
                            divine body, again and again, many hundreds of thousands of crores of
                            times. My report is as follows. I came here from Krorayina and brought
                            the <span class="bibit">rete</span> camels. Up till today there has been no buying and
                            selling. This I make known at your feet. I wish to return to Krorayina.
                            Whatever news there is of you there, you should send me a letter. I will
                            bring it to my father the <span class="bibit">guśura</span> in Krorayina, at the time
                            you have to go. Also the royal dues (<span class="bibit">harga</span>) from this
                            village were granted to us from the feet of his majesty. Now the
                            authorities are causing much pain to the slaves. For that reason, along
                            with the <span class="bibit">guśura</span> Puṃñaśa [. . .] is to be made. This is the
                            third time that I have sent a letter of information to the feet of the
                                <span class="bibit">guśura</span>. I have heard nothing from there. To my dear
                            elder brother Bhatiśam̄a [. . .<br>

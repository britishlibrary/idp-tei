              This document concerning a cow eaten by thieves is to be carefully kept

              In the 38th year, 12th month, 2nd day of his majesty 
                            the great king [. . .] the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Pultsaya and
                            the <span class="bibit">tasucas</span> Naramas̱ena and Ḍhaǵiya judged a dispute.
                            Tsimaya, Portsaya Varpeya, Tameca, Racǵe, and Tsordhoe brought the
                            action. They (i.e. Portsaya, etc.) stole and ate a six
                            year old cow belonging to Tsimaya. The skin and flesh ( ? ). Considering
                            this matter we have decided on a recompense three times the amount. A
                            quarter of this recompense, (namely) one six year old cow with calf is
                            to be delivered by Portsaya, Tameca, and Varpeya. The (other)
                            three-quarters, (namely) a three year old cow with calf, is to be
                            delivered by Racǵeya and Tsordhoe. (These) are to be delivered by these
                            thieves and taken by Tsimaya. We have given them fifty blows. A decision

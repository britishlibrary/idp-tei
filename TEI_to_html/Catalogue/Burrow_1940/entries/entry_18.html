              His majesty, etc. . . . Suḡ́ita informs us that Lýimo, Puǵo, and Opǵe
                            made a division of all their property. Now Opǵeya has carried off the
                            people. Along with Lýipeya he upsets the <span class="bibit">nukaṃja</span> (= ?), and
                            does not allow them to make cultivation. When this sealed wedge-tablet
                            reaches you, etc. . . .<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: The term <span class="bibit">nukaṃja</span> occurs nowhere else and its meaning
                            is quite obscure.<br>

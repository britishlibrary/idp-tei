              This document concerning a girl adopted from Priyapata is to be kept
                            carefully by Kacana.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">kala</span> Puṃñabala.<br>
              In the 11th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mairi the son of
                            heaven, in the 2nd month, on the 8th day, at this date, (there is) a man
                            called Priyapata belonging to the district of the son of the great king,
                            the <span class="bibit">kala</span> Puṃñabala. To him a daughter was born. They wanted
                            to expose her on the ground. Kacana took her up from the ground. Kacana
                            gave the " milk-fee " to Priyapata. It was settled as one horse. That
                            girl is not to be sold by Kacana, nor mortgaged, nor removed from
                            his-house, and she is not to be ill-treated in the house. She is to be
                            regarded as his own daughter With reference to this girl in the future,
                            a second (different) statement is not to be brought up by the man
                            Priyavata or by her mother. (The document) has been written by me, the
                                <span class="bibit">śramana</span> Moc̄h́abudhi at the command of
                                <span class="bibit">kala</span> Puṃñabala, son of the great king. It is

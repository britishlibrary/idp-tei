              In the 11th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mairi the son of
                            heaven, in the 2nd month, on the 8th day, at this date, (there is) a man

                            the <span class="bibit">kala</span> Puṃñabala. To him a daughter was born. They wanted
                            to expose her on the ground. Kacana took her up from the ground. Kacana
                            gave the " milk-fee " to Priyapata. It was settled as one horse. That
                            girl is not to be sold by Kacana, nor mortgaged, nor removed from
                            his-house, and she is not to be ill-treated in the house. She is to be
                            regarded as his own daughter With reference to this girl in the future,

                            Priyavata or by her mother. (The document) has been written by me, the

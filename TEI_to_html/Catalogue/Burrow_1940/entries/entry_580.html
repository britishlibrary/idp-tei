            <br>
            
              This document concerning <span class="bibit">miṣiya</span>-land of Saǵima is to be carefully
                            preserved by the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Ramṣotsa.<br>
              In the 19th year, 10th month, 6th day of the reign of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha
                            Aṃgoka, son of heaven, there is a man called Saǵima. He arose and sold
                            to the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Ramṣotsa <span class="bibit">miṣiya</span> land with a
                            capacity for seed of a <span class="bibit">khi</span> in excess of (one)
                                <span class="bibit">milima</span> (?). There was also some <span class="bibit">akri</span>-land
                            adjoining that (with a capacity for seed) of one <span class="bibit">milima</span>. He
                            sold both those pieces of land. And so Saǵima received as price of the
                            land from the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Ramṣotsa, one horse four years old
                            valued at forty. This was received by Saǵima. Further as <span class="bibit">atǵa
                                suḍ́a</span> price was received one <span class="bibit">milima</span> ten
                                <span class="bibit">khi</span> of corn. They agreed on equal terms in front of the
                            magistrates <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> V́arpa and <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Karaṃtsa.
                            Witnesses are the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃghas</span> Vekuṃjiya and Kuraǵeya, the
                                <span class="bibit">śadavidas</span> Pakuv́aya and Kuluca, the
                                <span class="bibit">śadavidas</span> Vapika and Purzavara, the scribe Apǵeya, the
                                <span class="bibit">sotira tasuca</span> Catata, and Kaṃjiya, son of the
                                <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Karaṃtsa. Therefore in that <span class="bibit">miṣiya</span>
                            land and also in the <span class="bibit">akriya</span>-land, from now on the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span>
                            Ramṣotsa has ownership, to plough, to sow, to give to another as a
                            present, to exchange, to enjoy in all ways whatever is wanted to be
                            done. Whoever at a future time informs, disputes, or disagrees about
                            this, his bringing up again of the matter shall be without authority at
                            the king's court.<br>
              We the magistrates have seen both those lands. That
                            land is north of Seni. For that reason we the magistrates have issued a
                            command, we have written a letter of command and a receipt. Who-ever a
                            second time shall bring up the question of the land again, they shall
                            impose a penalty on him, (namely a fine of) a horse and seventy strokes.
                            This document was written by me the scribe Moǵata, son of the scribe
                            Tamasṕa, at the command of the magistrates. Its authority is a hundred
                            years, as long as life. It was written at the request of Saǵima.<br>
              The <span class="bibit">ageta</span> Koiiaya cut the string.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: U.O. (3) <span class="bibit">atri varo</span> remains obscure.<br>
              C.R. (2) After <span class="bibit">aśpa</span>, <span class="bibit">v́e na kri ṭha</span> is obscure. Possibly for <span class="bibit">v́e</span>, <span class="bibit">tre</span> "three" might be read. Nothing can be made of the rest.<br>

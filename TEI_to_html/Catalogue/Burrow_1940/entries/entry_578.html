              (U. O. 1). In the 11th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mayiri,
                            son of heaven, in the 2nd month, 2nd day, in this reign, the
                                <span class="bibit">ogus</span> Dajapala, Ḍhapaya, Śamas̱ena, and Ldas̱a, the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Jayatrada and the <span class="bibit">cozbos</span> Bimbhas̱ena
                            and Soṃjaka examined this dispute. Suḡ́uta and Priyavaǵa brought the
                            action concerning a girl and a camel. (It's alleged) that Suḡ́uta gave a
                            camel to Priyavaǵa to break in (<span class="bibit">dhamanaye</span>). While with him
                            it died. Therefore Priyavaǵa gave a woman called Koloae to Suḡ́uta. In
                            return for the woman Suḡ́uta gave to Priyavaǵa a present of carpet eight
                            hands (in length). Considering this we have decided that henceforth
                            Priyavaǵa has no claim to payment from Suḡ́uta on account of the woman,
                            nor has Suḡ́uta any claim against Priyavaǵa on account of the camel.<br>

              There is every reason to fear from the Supis. You must not be slack.
                            Watch is to be maintained in Saca continually. Whatever news comes from
                            Khotan, you must let me know. Whatever news comes from the king's court
                            or from the Supis, you will be informed. Also you have investigated the
                            goldsmiths of the people of Parvata there.<br>

              He is appropriating without just cause. (He is) appropriating much. (It is) hereditary property.<br>

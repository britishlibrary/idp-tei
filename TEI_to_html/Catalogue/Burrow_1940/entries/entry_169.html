            <br>
            
              In the 26th year of His majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mayiri, son of
                            heaven, in the 10th month, at this date, the people measured out the
                                <span class="bibit">śuki</span> wine.<br>
              (The rest of the document consists of a list.)<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: <span class="bibit">śparna</span> (E. 2, F. 5) cannot very well from the context be = <span class="bibit">suv́arna</span> (as taken in <span class="bibit">Grammar</span>, § 49). It would be most natural to take it as a measure smaller than a <span class="bibit">khi</span>. That, however, is elsewhere expressed by <span class="bibit">caṣaǵa</span>.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . . . . . . . Bhimas̱ena informs us, that he has
                            received the queen's cows; that he is keeper of the sheep in Yav́e av́ana
                            and also <span class="bibit">yatma</span> of the <span class="bibit">kuv́ana</span> corn; and that now you are
                            handing over the king's cows to him. This is not lawful that one man
                            should hold five or six offices. When this wedge and seal reach you, you
                            must make careful inquiry whether he has really held so many offices.
                            (If so) the king's cows are not any more to be handed over to him. The
                            king's cows are to be handed over to a man who has not held (any other)
                            offices.<br>

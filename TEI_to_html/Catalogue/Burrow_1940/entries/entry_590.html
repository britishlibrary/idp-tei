              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              This deed concerning a woman Lýipaae is to be kept by the scribe
                            Ramṣotsa.<br>
              In the 17th year of the reign of his majesty the great
                            king Jiṭugha Amguvaka, son of heaven, in the 4th month, 28th day, there
                            is a man called Śāṃcā. He arose and sold a woman called Lýipaae to the
                            scribe Ramṣotsa. Śāṃcā received the price of the woman Lýipaae from the
                            scribe Ramṣotsa. He received one <span class="bibit">viyala</span> camel valued at
                            forty, and a second <span class="bibit">aṃkla &lt; tsa &gt;</span> camel valued at
                            thirty, one carpet twelve hands long, and a second carpet eleven hands
                            long. Also received were eight <span class="bibit">sutra muli</span>. The total price
                            is ninety-eight. So they agreed on equal terms. From now on the scribe
                            Ramṣotsa has ownership of that woman, to beat her, to bind her, to sell
                            her, to give her to others as a present, to exchange her, to pledge her,
                            to do whatever he likes with her. Witnesses to this are the
                                <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> V́arpa and the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Karaṃtsa, the
                                <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span> Kuv́aya and Capuǵa, the <span class="bibit">apsu</span> Pitǵa
                            and the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> V́apika, the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Kuuna, the
                                <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Cato and Śapuǵa, the <span class="bibit">karsenav́a</span>
                            Vuǵinǵa, the <span class="bibit">śadavida</span> Pursavara, and the
                                <span class="bibit">karsenav́a</span> Riciḱǵa. Whoever at a future time informs or
                            disagrees about this, his bringing up again of the matter shall be
                            without authority at the king's court. This deed was written by me the
                            scribe Moǵata, son of the scribe Tamasṕa, at the command of the
                            magistrates. Its authority is a hundred years as long as life.<br>
              This was written at the request of Śāṃcā.<br>
              The Yatma Cato by name cut the string.<br>

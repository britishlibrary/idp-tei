                            as follows: Lýipeya makes a complaint here now that soldiers of Saca
                            carried off two cows of his. One cow they sent back, one they ate. This
                            dispute must be carefully investigated by you in person and a decision
                            made according to law; if you are not clear about it there, they must be
                            sent here in custody.<br>

                            information concerning him. He is the <span class="bibit">yatma</span> of the
                                <span class="bibit">kvav́ana</span> corn. He is to be let go and released from that
                            office. (Someone is to be made <span class="bibit">yatma</span>) who has formerly been
                                <span class="bibit">yatma</span> of the <span class="bibit">kvav́ana</span> corn. When this wedge

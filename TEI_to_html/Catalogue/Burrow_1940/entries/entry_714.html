              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              The <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Takra sends health to the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Opǵeya
                            and Tǵaca, etc. . . I have sent this Tsuǵeta there concerning the state
                            of the taxation in Ajiyama Av́ana. Just as formerly the tax was assessed
                            in Ajiyama Av́ana (as follows, namely): ghee, sheep, <span class="bibit">kośava</span>,
                            <span class="bibit">arnavaj́i</span>, carpet (<span class="bibit">thavastae</span>), <span class="bibit">raj́i</span>,
                            felt (<span class="bibit">naṃmatae</span>), <span class="bibit">cāṃdri</span>, and <span class="bibit">kaṃmaṃta</span>; in
                            addition, <span class="bibit">maḱa</span>, <span class="bibit">oǵana</span>, and <span class="bibit">crom̄a</span> ( ? ), and all
                            the rest of the tax; so now it is quickly to be sent here all complete
                            in the hand of the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Lýipeya and Tsuǵeta. The tax of
                            the <span class="bibit">v́eǵa kilme</span> women is to be demanded all complete. Also
                            in the rainy season (<span class="bibit">varṣavasaṃmi</span>) you <span class="bibit">vásus</span>,
                                <span class="bibit">aǵetas</span>, and <span class="bibit">yatmas</span> must come herein the
                            fourth month from the exterior provinces and the central kingdom (?).
                            There is an investigation into the conditions of taxation. He who really
                            does provide his tax (well and good); he who does not is to be removed.
                            Also you have a yearly deficit in your tax returns. If you again send
                            the tax short, you will certainly pay from your own establishment. Just
                            as formerly provisions were given to messengers so now they are to be
                            taken by Tsuǵeta. You have cut off the tax from your own farm year by
                            year.<br>

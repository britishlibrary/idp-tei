                            too are well here. Hearing that, you should be pleased. And thus we
                            write. From former times we have been united in a bond of friendship,
                            and even so we are still united in a bond of friendship. You must not
                            forget this. We have sent this Danutreya there to inspect the stock of
                            draught animals. By all means let him be under your care. Whatever
                            affairs you have are in like manner under our care. The <span class="bibit">ogu</span>
                            Paṃcama has sent one <span class="bibit">prasta</span> of <span class="bibit">mepoǵa</span>; the suv́eṭha Piteya
                            has sent betel (<span class="bibit">driṃpura</span>) in a bag (<span class="bibit">pras̱evaǵami</span>).<br>

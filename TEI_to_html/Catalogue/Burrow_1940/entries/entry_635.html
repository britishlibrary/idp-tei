              [. . . .] is to be bought and sent here. If you do not get much from
                            there, more is to be bought from the mountain. Certainly much ghee and
                            meat is to be dispatched here. Also you Saǵamoya must go to the mountain
                            along with Multeya. A decision is to be made carefully about the corn.
                            If you do not do this carefully now, you will later have to pay this
                            corn outfox your own. Also in the mountain <span class="bibit">yoǵa</span> is
                            certainly to be bought.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: The meaning of <span class="bibit">yoǵa</span> here is quite obscure.<br>

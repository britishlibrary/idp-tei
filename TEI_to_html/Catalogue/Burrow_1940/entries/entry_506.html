              In the 31st year of his majesty the great king, Jiṭuga Aṃgoka, son of
                            heaven, in the first month, 10th day, in this reign, the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Varunaśam̄a,
                            the <span class="bibit">suveṭha</span> Sṕalýaya, the <span class="bibit">jenavida caṃkura</span> Kuviñeya, the
                            <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Poniǵana, and the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Jivaśam̄a examined this
                            dispute. The monk Tatiǵa took the monk Bhatra from the monk Śamca. Along
                            with him he came here to the capital. On account of the monk Bhatra
                            Tatiǵa provided a slave called Śraṣdha to work for Śāṃca. And thus they
                            made the agreement. That slave Śrāṣḍha was not to be left in the house.
                            He was to be worked by Śāṃca until the return of Tatiǵa and Bhatra. Even
                            now these monks have not returned from the capital. Śraṣḍha took another
                            slave called Śanaṃma belonging to Tatiǵa and handed him over to Śāṃcā to
                            work for him. This Śraṣdha along with a slave of Śāṃca fled to Khema.
                            The monk Śāṃca made a statement (to this effect): The people of Tatiǵa's
                            house gave food and clothing to that Śraṣḍha. He stole my slave and fled
                            away. The monk Sujata (also) made a statement. The community of monks in
                            Caḍ́ota examined the dispute and decided it. Tatiǵa had to swear an
                            oath. Tatiǵa swore along with five people of his household. This Śraṣḍha
                            was to be looked for by Śāṃca. They brought (him) to hand (him) over to
                            Tatiǵa. Concerning (this) the monks Śāṃca [and . . .]<br>

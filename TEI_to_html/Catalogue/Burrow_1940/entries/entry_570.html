              This document concerning a female camel from Śaras̱ena is to be kept by
                            Suḡ́uta and Suḡ́i.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">ogus</span> Ḍhapaya and Śamasena.<br>
              In the 11th year, 2nd month, 1st day, in the reign of his majesty the great
                            king Jiṭugha Mairi, son of heaven, the <span class="bibit">ogus</span> Dhapaya and
                            Ṣamas̱ena, the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Toǵaj́a, and the '<span class="bibit">cozbo</span>
                            Biṃmas̱ena examined this dispute. Suḡ́uta and Suḡ́i complained concerning
                            one camel, as follows. It happened that Kupṣuta arose and took one camel
                            from Śaras̱ena by force. He handed over the camel to Suḡ́uta and Suḡ́i on
                            account of a debt. That camel was two years with Suḡ́uta and Suḡ́i. After
                            that Śaras̱ena arose and took the camel from Suḡ́uta and Suḡ́i. He caused
                            its death in the desert. We have decided that in place of the pregnant
                            female camel a <span class="bibit">kirsos̱a</span> female camel of the same age is to
                            be handed over by Śaras̱ena and taken by Suḡ́uta and Suḡ́i. Any
                            complaints Śaras̱ena has to make he must bring up with Kupṣuta. That
                            female camel three years old is to be given.<br>

              In the 4th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Vaṣmana, son of
                            heaven, in the 12th month, 30th day, in this reign: As Lýipeya has
                            received in Caḍ́ota, in Catis̱a devi av́ana (?) <span class="bibit">kurora</span> land
                            (with a capacity of seed) of 4 <span class="bibit">milima</span> adjoining
                                (<span class="bibit">anusaṃti</span>) land in Vaṃtu av́ana, so the
                                <span class="bibit">vasu</span> and <span class="bibit">ogu</span> [. . . ] made an agreement.
                            When Lýipeya shall plough that land, at that time 2 <span class="bibit">khi</span> of
                            ghee is to be sent here as rent (<span class="bibit">vaka</span>) It is not to- be
                            stopped by the <span class="bibit">vases</span> and <span class="bibit">agetas</span> in
                            Caḍ́ota.<br>

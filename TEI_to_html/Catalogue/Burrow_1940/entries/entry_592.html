            <br>
            
              Concerning the woman Lyimisoae, to be kept by the scribe Ramṣotsa.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kaṃciya.<br>
              In the 32nd year, 12th month, 20th day of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Aṃguvaka, son of
                            heaven, there is a man called Palnaṃto. He arose (and sold) to the
                            scribe Ramṣotsa a girl Lýimisoae four <span class="bibit">diṣṭis</span> high. The
                            price given was one <span class="bibit">aṃklatsa</span> camel valued at thirty.
                            Pulnaṃto received it and in addition as <span class="bibit">atǵa muli</span> one
                            Khotanese <span class="bibit">koj́ava</span>. So they agreed. From now on Ramṣotsa has
                            ownership of the woman Lýimisoae, to beat her, to bind her, to sell her,
                            to exchange her, to pledge her, to do whatever he likes with her. This
                            was written in front of the magistrates. Witnesses are the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kaṃciya, the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Acuñiya, the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Kuv́aya, Sarivara, Ḱuṃtsena, Kuṣaṃta, Lýimo,
                            the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Cato, the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> V́apika, the monks
                            Dhamila and Śilaprava and the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Opǵeya. Whoever at a
                            future time informs, disputes, or disagrees about this, his bringing up
                            again of the matter shall be without authority at the king's court. This
                            was written by me the scribe Moǵata at the command of the magistrates.
                            Its authority is as long as life.<br>
              The <span class="bibit">apsu</span> Vuṣḍhaya cut the string.<br>

              In the 9th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Vaṣmana, son of
                            heaven, 3rd month, 5th day, at this date, Larsu says: It is a fact that
                            in Caḍ́ota the monk Anaṃdasena received 30 <span class="bibit">milima</span> of corn
                            on loan from Cuǵopa. Further he received 15 <span class="bibit">khi</span> of wine on
                            loan. In addition the slave of this monk Anaṃdas̱ena, Budhagoṣa by name,
                            he stole from the house of me (and) Cuǵopa 12 lengths of silk
                                (<span class="bibit">paṭa</span>) and also 3 <span class="bibit">urnavaraṇḍe</span>, 2 ropes
                                (<span class="bibit">rasaṃna</span>), 3 felt garments (<span class="bibit">namati</span>), 4
                            sheep, 1 <span class="bibit">ares̱a</span> amounting in all
                                (<span class="bibit">sarvapiṃḍa-gaṃnanena</span>) to the value of 100
                                <span class="bibit">muli</span>. Concerning this matter Cuǵopa swore an oath. Thus
                            the whole was to be paid over by the monk Anaṃdas̱ena and received by
                            Cuǵopa and Larsu. Further that monk was owing at the court
                                (<span class="bibit">dvara[ṃmi]</span>) a fine of one cow. Now again the monk
                            Anaṃdas̱ena made representations with Larsu and made efforts. So Larsu
                            desirous of acquiring merit together with the monk Anaṃdas̱ena, they
                            came to an agreement with each other outside (the court). This monk gave
                            the thief man Budhagoṣa to Larsu as equivalent to the value (namely) 110
                                <span class="bibit">muli</span> of the corn Anaṃdas̱ena received on loan and the
                            twelve lengths of cloth (etc.) that were stolen. Also the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Larsu abandoned his claims against the monk
                            Anaṃdas̱ena for this 110 <span class="bibit">muli</span>. From this day forth Larsu
                            shall have no claim against the monk Anaṃdas̱ena concerning this 110
                                <span class="bibit">muli</span> and the [thefts] of his slave. Neither shall the
                            monk Anaṃdas̱ena have any claim against Larsu concerning this thief man
                            of his. Everything has been settled and a decision has been reached. If
                            at a future time the monk Anaṃdas̱ena or his son or grandson, or any
                            kinsman of his or son of a kinsman should want to alter this, or should
                            stir up a dispute about the decision, in such a case their renewal of
                            action (<span class="bibit">muha cotaṃna</span>) shall be without authority and they
                            shall incur a penalty. They shall pay as a penalty into the royal funds
                                (<span class="bibit">[ra]yakaṃmi</span>), thirty lengths of cloth, and having paid
                            all this penalty, without doubt it shall continue as is written above.

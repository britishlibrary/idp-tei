                                <span class="bibit">acoviṃna</span>, came here from Saca. He says that the Supis

                            Kunas̱ena there (so) another horseman is to be sent here quickly. There
                            is no <span class="bibit">acoviṃna</span> man from there in the mountains.<br>

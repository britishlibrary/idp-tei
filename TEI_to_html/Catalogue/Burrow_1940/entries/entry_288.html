                            It is a long time since we were able to send you a letter and a present.

                            care. Let them do nothing in disregard of him.We have sent a small
                            present so that you need not worry about a present. Later we will send a
                            letter and present in the hand of Dharmapriya, which will be worthy of
                            you — from Yili one rope, and from Namilǵaae one <span class="bibit">lastuǵa</span> To

                            be written down individually by name on a receipt and sent here. Also
                            there is a jar of wine with Priyavata belonging to the year before last.
                            He says that this jar is broken. These two jars are to be paid off by
                            Priyavata. If you receive many goats they are to be brought here with
                            Sukmana.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . . And now the business of the wine has come up at
                            Calmadana. When this letter of command shall arrive there, forthwith
                            wine (capable of being carried) by five camels is to be sent here in the
                            hand o f this Caulǵeya. The load of one camel is 1 <span class="bibit">milima</span> 1
                                <span class="bibit">khi</span>, so that he can measure out 1 <span class="bibit">milima</span>
                            complete in Calmadana. From there [. . . ] together the wine is to be
                            taken. This wine should be taken to Calmadana on the fifth day of the
                            fourth month. By no means let there be any [. . . . . .] of the
                            wine.<br>

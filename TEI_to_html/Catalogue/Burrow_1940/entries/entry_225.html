              Note: This document is rendered unusually obscure, partly on account of
                            its fragmentary nature, and partly because of the number of isolated and
                            unexplained words occurring in it. Unexplained words are:
                                <span class="bibit">racana</span> (<span class="bibit">śata racana</span>, <span class="bibit">śata</span> may
                            of course mean "100", in which case "200 <span class="bibit">racana</span>"),
                                <span class="bibit">vusṕarta</span>, the reading of which cannot be determined
                            with certainty since it is found nowhere else, <span class="bibit">ares̱a</span> which
                            occurs elsewhere without its being possible to define its meaning, and
                                <span class="bibit">giṃta</span>, some commodity measured in <span class="bibit">khi</span>,
                                <span class="bibit">oṣaḍha</span> cannot be = <span class="bibit">asuṣadha</span> (<span class="bibit">Khar.
                            Inscri.</span>, p. 305), since there is no reason why <span class="bibit">dh</span> should
                            change to <span class="bibit">ḍh</span>. The word <span class="bibit">potǵa</span> (R. 7) may be
                            short for <span class="bibit">potǵoñena</span> which occurs frequently in connection
                            with <span class="bibit">masu</span> "wine" as also does <span class="bibit">ṣamiyo</span>. Of
                            neither has the meaning been determined. In that case understand
                                <span class="bibit">milima</span> before the figure 2. <span class="bibit">pir.ci</span> may be
                            connected with <span class="bibit">piro</span> "bridge".<br>

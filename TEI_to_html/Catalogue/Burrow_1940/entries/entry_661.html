              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              On the 18th day of the 10th month of the 3rd year, at this time in the
                            reign of the king of Khotan, the king of kings, Hinaza Deva Vijitasiṃha,
                            at that time there is a man of the city called Khvarnarse. He speaks
                            thus: There is a camel belonging to me. That camel carries a
                            distinguishing mark, a mark branded on it, like this — VA ŚO. Now I am
                            selling this camel for a price of 8,000 <span class="bibit">māṣa</span> to the
                                <span class="bibit">suliǵa</span> Vaǵiti Vadhaǵa. On behalf of that camel Vaǵiti
                            Vadhaǵa paid the whole price in <span class="bibit">māṣa</span> and Khvarnarse
                            received it. The matter has been settled. From now on this camel has
                            become the property of Vaǵiti Vadhaǵa, to do as he likes with it, to do
                            everything he likes. Whoever at a future time complains, informs, or
                            raises a dispute about this camel, for that he shall so pay the penalty
                            as the law of the kingdom demands. By me Bahudhiva this document (?) was
                            written at the request of Khvarnarse.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: This document was first translated by P. S. Noble (<span class="bibit">BSOS.</span>, v (1931), pp. 445 ff.). The dialect  has been discussed in detail by me (<span class="bibit">BSOS.</span>, viii (1936), pp. 430 ff.). Sten Konow treats of it in a useful article (<span class="bibit">Act. Or.</span>, xiii (1936), 231–240), from which certain improvements in reading have been adopted: for <span class="bibit">Hinajhasya a vij́ida</span> —, read <span class="bibit">hinajha deva Vij́ida</span> and for <span class="bibit">aghita drij́u</span>, <span class="bibit">aghi tadrij́u</span>. Konow takes <span class="bibit">aghi</span> as = <span class="bibit">aṅge</span>, on the body. More likely as taken here it is = Skt. <span class="bibit">aṅka</span> "mark" (cf. <span class="bibit">Grammar</span>, § 46).<br>

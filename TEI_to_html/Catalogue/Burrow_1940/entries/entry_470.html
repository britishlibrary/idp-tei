              His majesty, etc. . . . Yap«µu informs us that last year he took out a
                            camel. You have made a reckoning this year. You have made a written
                            document. This document has been brought here.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: (2) The reading <span class="bibit">asya</span> is somewhat doubtful. In the edition <span class="bibit">vana</span> is proposed as an alternative. The genitive <span class="bibit">asya</span> (of the pronoun) does not occur in this language, and may therefore be ruled out. Probably <span class="bibit">tusya</span> should be read.<br>
              (3) <span class="bibit">katvetha</span> presumably means "you have made", and so I have translated. If so it is an irregular and corrupt form.<br>

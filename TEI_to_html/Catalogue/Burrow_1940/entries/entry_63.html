              His majesty, etc. . . . Lýipeya reports that they took out three
                            witch-women. They killed only the woman belonging to him, the remaining
                            women they released. About this matter you received a command from
                            Apǵeya that recompense was to be made to Lýipeya for this woman. When
                            this sealed wedge-tablet, etc. . . . you must inquire, and according as
                            you the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> received oral instructions here at the king's
                            court, in such manner recompense must be made to Lýipeya for this
                            woman.<br>

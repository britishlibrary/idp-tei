              His majesty, etc. . . . The woman Tamaṣyanae stayed here with the herds
                            in place of Yitas̱ena. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, you
                            must investigate whether Tamaṣyanae really stayed with the herds in
                            place of Yitas̱ena, and according to the old law of the kingdom
                            clothing, food, and wages must be given her. If there is any dispute
                            there will be a decision in our presence.<br>

              Concerning royal camels, to be kept by Ramṣotsa and Lýipatǵa.<br>
              In the 33rd year, 7th month, 25th day of the reign of his majesty the great king
                            Jiṭuga Aṃǵoka, son of heaven, the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kaṃjiya judged a
                            dispute. Ramṣotsa, the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Kuuna and Cato have a dispute
                            about royal camels. Now they have given here from Ramṣotsa and Lýipatǵa
                                <span class="bibit">kaj́aha vaṃnaǵa</span> two hands long, carpet
                                (<span class="bibit">tāvastaǵa</span>) four hands long. Further Lýipatǵa gave one
                            Khotanese <span class="bibit">koj́ava</span> and carpet six hands long. What Ramṣotsa
                            and Lýipatǵa gave is settled (and what) Kuritǵa received is settled.
                            Whoever at a future time (disputes this), there shall be no payment
                            due.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: C.O. 2. For <span class="bibit">thavidavo</span> read <span class="bibit">tharidavo</span>.<br>
              U.O. 4. Lüders deals with <span class="bibit">kajaha vaṃnaǵa</span> in <span class="bibit">Textilien im alten Turkestan</span>, p. 23. Taking the alternative reading <span class="bibit">kaṭahavaṃnaǵa</span> (Ed., n. 3), he compares <span class="bibit">kaṭathavaṃne</span>, 207. This seems very plausible and the <span class="bibit">-h-</span> may be an error of writing. The change <span class="bibit">th</span> &gt; <span class="bibit">h</span> which is regular in the interior of words is hardly to be expected at the beginning of the second member of a compound like this.<br>
              C.R. For <span class="bibit">na tanana garhana</span> read <span class="bibit">na tana na grahana</span>. This term usually occurs in the form of a dvandva compound <span class="bibit">danagrahana</span> "giving and taking", hence "a payment". Here the negative is repeated before each of the component words.<br>

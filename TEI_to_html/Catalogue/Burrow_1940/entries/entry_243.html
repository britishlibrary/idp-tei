              His majesty, etc. . . . Larsu informs us that Cakvala gave a horse to his
                            father the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena as a present. As a return for
                            this two sheep and three <span class="bibit">hasta varṣe</span> were handed over [. .
                            . .]. The <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena died. This horse Cakva [la. . .
                            .] took. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, you must forthwith
                            carefully inquire in person whether it is really true that a high
                            official has given away as a present something legally belonging to the

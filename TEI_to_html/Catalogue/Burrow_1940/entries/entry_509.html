              His majesty, etc. . . . Caṣǵe informs us that he is the royal <span class="bibit">sruva
                                toṃga</span> He put these mares under the care of Suv́aya to look
                            after. He gave him keep and wages. From them Suv́aya gave one mare for
                            hunting stags. As a result of that the mare died. When this sealed
                            wedge-tablet reaches you, forthwith careful investigation must be made
                            in your presence (as to whether) it is really so. It is not right that
                            he gives away people's property for other people to ride on. This
                            dispute, etc. . . .<br>

              Notes: Read <span class="bibit">gavas̄a</span> as one word. <span class="bibit">Gavas̄a</span>, i.e. <span class="bibit">gavasna</span> is an Iranian word meaning "deer": Av. <span class="bibit">gavasna-</span>, Sogd. <span class="bibit">γ'βzn</span>, Khotanese <span class="bibit">gguysna-</span>.<br>
              The term <span class="bibit">sruva toṃga</span> recurs in No. 524 as <span class="bibit">surva toṃga</span>. It refers in both cases to a man in charge of horses. <span class="bibit">Toṃga</span> is the same word as occurs frequently by itself as a title. The exact significance of the term <span class="bibit">sruva</span> (<span class="bibit">surva</span>) remains obscure.<br>

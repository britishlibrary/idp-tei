                            scribe Ramṣotsa.<br>
              In the 21st year of the reign of his majesty the great
                            king Jiṭugha Aṃkvaǵa, son of heaven, there is a man Lýipta belonging to

                                <span class="bibit">ciraiṃta</span> land with a capacity for <span class="bibit">sahini</span>
                            seed of seven <span class="bibit">khi</span>. They agreed on equal terms in front of
                            the magistrates. From now on in that land the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span>

                            the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Argiya, Ariṣṕa, and the <span class="bibit">yatma</span>
                            Cato. Whoever at a future time shall bring up this matter again before
                            the <span class="bibit">v́asus</span> and <span class="bibit">aǵetas</span>, their bringing up again

                            was written by me the scribe Moǵata, son of the scribe Tamasṕa, at the
                            command of the magistrates. Its authority is a hundred years, as long as
                            life. Lýipta has sold and sold well, the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Ramṣotsa

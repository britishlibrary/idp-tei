            <br>
            
              This deed concerning land sold by Lýipta is to be carefully kept by the
                            scribe Ramṣotsa.<br>
              In the 21st year of the reign of his majesty the great
                            king Jiṭugha Aṃkvaǵa, son of heaven, there is a man Lýipta belonging to
                            Mañgeya, and Śāṃcā. They arose and sold to the scribe Ramṣotsa
                                <span class="bibit">ciraiṃta</span> land with a capacity for <span class="bibit">sahini</span>
                            seed of seven <span class="bibit">khi</span>. They agreed on equal terms in front of
                            the magistrates. From now on in that land the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span>
                            Ramṣotsa has ownership, to sow, to plough, to exchange, to sell, to
                            mortgage, to do whatever he likes within. They agreed in front of the
                            magistrates <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> V́arpa and <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Karaṃtsa.
                            Witnesses are the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Acuñiya, the <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span>
                            Śāṃcā, the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Kuuna, the <span class="bibit">śadavida</span> Moǵata,
                            the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Argiya, Ariṣṕa, and the <span class="bibit">yatma</span>
                            Cato. Whoever at a future time shall bring up this matter again before
                            the <span class="bibit">v́asus</span> and <span class="bibit">aǵetas</span>, their bringing up again
                            of the matter shall be without authority at the king's court. This deed
                            was written by me the scribe Moǵata, son of the scribe Tamasṕa, at the
                            command of the magistrates. Its authority is a hundred years, as long as
                            life. Lýipta has sold and sold well, the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Ramṣotsa
                            has bought and bought well. This was written at the request of Lýipta
                            and Śāṃcā.<br>
              As price of that land six <span class="bibit">khi</span> of wine and ten
                                <span class="bibit">khi</span> of corn was given in front of those witnesses. The
                            price given for that land was ten <span class="bibit">muli</span>.<br>

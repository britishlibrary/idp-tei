              His majesty, etc. . . . Opǵeya reports that he has one horse (which he
                            lent to Lýimiṃna). Lýimina died. His dependent (heir) Siǵayita took it,
                            and refuses to give back the horse to Opǵeya. When this sealed
                            wedge-tablet, etc. . . . you must investigate. You must make a careful
                            reckoning (of the value) of the farm and living-house which Lyimiṃna's
                            heir received, and from that he must speedily give a horse to
                            Opǵeya.<br>

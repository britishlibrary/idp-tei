              His majesty, etc. . . Suḡ́iya complains that he is a tax-gatherer
                                (<span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span>), also a scribe (<span class="bibit">divira</span>) in the
                            royal administration, and that again he is performing the duty of
                            frontier-guard (<span class="bibit">sṕas̱evaṃna</span>) along with Salve. Salve does
                            not hold any other offices. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you,
                            forthwith you must make careful inquiry in person whether he really
                            holds two offices and on top of that is performing the duty of
                            frontier-guard (<span class="bibit">sṕas̱avaṃna</span>). A decision is to be made in
                            accordance with the law of the land.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . Kuunǵe an Oǵana are <span class="bibit">klaseṃcis</span> for four
                            armies and you, further, make them keepers of the royal camels. They are
                            doing a job in the state service which added to their army (work) makes
                            five. (Inacting) thus, you do not do right, you do differently from the
                            command of me the great king. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you,
                            forthwith, whatever suitable people there are, the camels are to be
                            handed over to them from Kuunǵe. Kuunǵe and Oǵana have to perform their
                            original duties of <span class="bibit">klaseṃna</span> [. . .] in addition to that no
                            state duties are to be performed.<br>

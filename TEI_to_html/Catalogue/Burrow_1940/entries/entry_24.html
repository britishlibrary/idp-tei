              His majesty, etc. . . . Suḡ́ita reports that Caule is recovering a debt
                            of a horse from his slave Sarpiǵa. They are willing to hand over this
                            horse, but Caule does not want to take it. He wants to take as payment
                            of Sarpiǵa's debt the house and land which was received by Suḡ́ita from
                            the feet of his majesty. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, you
                            must forthwith carefully investigate whether it is really so. Such is
                            not the law, that the property of the master should be taken for the
                            debt of the slave. According to the former law of the kingdom decision
                            is to be made. If you are not clear, etc. . . .<br>

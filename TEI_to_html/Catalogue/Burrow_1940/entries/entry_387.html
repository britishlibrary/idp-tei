              His majesty, etc. . . . (3) You sent a letter of information in the hand
                            of Opǵeya. From that I the great king have become informed about
                            everything. Also you inform us that the <span class="bibit">kuv́ana</span> corn and
                            the <span class="bibit">śukha</span> wine [. . . ] should have received on loan. If
                            they have received it, to such an extent (<span class="bibit">tatiyemi</span>) the
                            whole amount is to be requisitioned and collected [. . . ]. This revenue
                            is to be brought here to the king's court. No obstruction is to be made.
                            Also formerly from there, the camels from the herd and the horses of the
                                <span class="bibit">klaseṃcis</span> here [. . . ] the <span class="bibit">suj́aǵas</span> (?)
                            are performing state duties. When this letter of command reaches you,
                            forthwith quickly 1 <span class="bibit">milima</span> 10 <span class="bibit">khi</span> of
                                <span class="bibit">rotaṃna</span> is [to be] taken from the
                                <span class="bibit">klaseṃcis</span> [. . . ]. Also in Samarena the revenue is to
                            be quickly sent here complete to the king's court. Also when the
                                <span class="bibit">toṃgas</span> and their attendants (<span class="bibit">upastaǵa</span>)
                            here [. . . ]. Ciṃgasena has taken ten camels belonging to
                                <span class="bibit">kala</span> Purnabala there. If he has really brought them,
                            these camels in equal numbers [. . . ]. Last year you withheld the
                            camels. If again you withhold these camels, from your own farm [. . . ].
                            Now the <span class="bibit">śamuṃta raya</span> is not to be sent, only two felt
                            garments are to be sent. Also a measure of thirty <span class="bibit">saḍ́a</span> are
                            to be sent [. . . ] is to be sent here in the hand of the
                                <span class="bibit">toṃghas</span>.<br>

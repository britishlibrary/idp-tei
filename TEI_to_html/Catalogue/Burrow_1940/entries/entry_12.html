              His majesty the king gives instructions to the <span class="bibit">cuv́alayina</span>
                            Maltsuta as follows: The <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span> Suḡ́ita informs us here
                            that his son Livarazma found in a gold <span class="bibit">śakasya</span> (= ?) one
                                <span class="bibit">kaṃpo</span> (= ?) and two golden staters, and that many
                            people of Caḍ́ota and the mountains are witnesses. In that matter the
                                <span class="bibit">taǵastas</span> are cheating (<span class="bibit">nikareṃti</span>) the
                            owners. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you, etc. . . . the
                                <span class="bibit">taǵastas</span> are to be stopped from doing injustice to
                            people.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: Nos. 12 and 43 form the two parts of the same document. The order
                            is 12 O, 43 O, 12 R, 43 R. The words <span class="bibit">śakasyami</span>,
                                <span class="bibit">kaṃpo</span>, and <span class="bibit">taǵastehi</span> occur nowhere else
                            and their meaning is obscure. The term <span class="bibit">taǵasta</span> indicates a
                            particular class of individual. The instrumental here is used for the
                            nominative by a common confusion (<span class="bibit">Gramm.</span>, § 117).<br>

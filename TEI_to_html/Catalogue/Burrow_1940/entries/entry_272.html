              His majesty the great king writes, he gives instructions to the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka, and so you must know what I write,
                            namely: When I have given a command to do with the affairs of the state,
                            day and night you must display zeal in the business of the state, guard
                            is to be kept (over the kingdom) with care, even at the expense of your
                            life; when there is any news from Khema and Khotan, you must send a
                            letter of information to the feet of me the great king. Also you sent
                            from there a letter of information in the hand of the <span class="bibit">toṃga</span>
                            Vukto; from that I the great king learnt about everything. Also it
                            appears that (<span class="bibit">ityartha</span>) since last year you have been in
                            great danger from the Supis and you settled the people of the kingdom
                            (province) inside the city. Now all the Supis have gone; where they were
                            formerly settled, there they have settled. In your province there has
                            come about a relaxation. Also there is peace and quiet from Khotan. Now
                            the <span class="bibit">lautǵaiṃci</span> people are to be written down. Only the city
                            is to be defended; the other people of the kingdom are to be left alone;
                            they are not again to be harassed (by being crowded) in the city. Also
                            last year the royal <span class="bibit">śuka</span> wine was collected there. Now it
                            is heard that the tax-collectors and officials of wine department have
                            used up all this wine. When this letter of instruction reaches you,
                            quickly thereupon last year's <span class="bibit">śuka</span>-wine and this year's
                            wine is to be collected all complete, and is to be poured together in
                            one place. Also just as there the <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Parkuta collected
                            and deposited the <span class="bibit">kuv́ana</span>, <span class="bibit">tsaṃghina</span>, and
                                <span class="bibit">koyimaṃḍhina</span> corn in all the offices of the city, even
                            so now let the <span class="bibit">kuv́ana</span>, <span class="bibit">tsaṃghina</span>, and
                                <span class="bibit">ko</span>[<span class="bibit">yimaṃḍhina</span> . . .] corn be collected and
                            [. . . ] in the city. Also letter-carriers shall come here to the king's
                            court on speedy business, let a beast be taken from whoever possesses
                            one and the hire be paid from the state at a regular rate, so that the
                            affairs of state shall not in any way become slack. Also let lucerne for
                            fodder be collected in the town. Day and night <span class="bibit">caṃdri</span>,
                                <span class="bibit">kamaṃta</span>, <span class="bibit">rotaṃ</span> (madder), and
                                <span class="bibit">curom̄a</span> are to be sent here quickly to the king's
                            court. Also it is heard that the people of the kingdom there are
                            harassing each other on account of old debts. These well-to-do people
                            are to be prevented from persecuting the debtor people. When there is
                            peace and quiet from Khotan and the kingdom is stable, at that time they
                            will pay. Also it is heard that there the serviceable well-born people
                            are very much disobeying the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka. They do not do
                            right (to act) thus. I have put the kingdom into the hands of this man
                            alone, (and) the state affairs are not to be run by everybody. From now
                            on he must be no more disobeyed. The man who disobeys the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka is to be sent here to the king's court,
                            and he will receive punishment here.<br>

              Note: Read <span class="bibit">masuvi</span> for <span class="bibit">masu vi</span> and cf. <span class="bibit">Grammar</span>,
                            § 75. Read <span class="bibit">sarva</span> for <span class="bibit">sarve</span> (5). Read
                                <span class="bibit">parc̄h́inavitaṃti</span> (5) as one word (<span class="bibit">Grammar</span>, § 104). For
                                <span class="bibit">ya sa</span> (7) read <span class="bibit">yasa</span> (=<span class="bibit">yas̱a</span>
                            Gen. S.). The term <span class="bibit">lautǵaiṃci</span> (4) which occurs only here is
                            of unknown meaning. For <span class="bibit">abhiṭhe</span> read <span class="bibit">aśpista</span>
                            "lucerne", and cf. note in 214. Separate <span class="bibit">caṃdrikaṃtarotaṃ</span>
                            as <span class="bibit">caṃdri kamaṃta rotaṃ</span>. In 714 <span class="bibit">cāṃdri kamaṃta</span>
                            occurs again. Since the two words do not occur separately we cannot be
                            sure whether there are two different commodities which happened to be
                            mentioned together on the two occasions where they occur, or whether it
                            is a compound expression. For <span class="bibit">[nṛve]na</span> (8) read
                                <span class="bibit">[ṛne]na</span> "debt" which is demanded by the context.<br>

              Śakha will look after the camels in place of Moǵata. The <span class="bibit">ari</span>
                            Kutǵeya is to be removed from the camels. The herd is to be fed. The
                                <span class="bibit">ari</span> Apeṃna has to ride out on a camel to the
                                <span class="bibit">aco</span>. Apeṃna has become sick. Later he must go as
                                <span class="bibit">acoviṃna</span>. Do not allow any slackness. If he does not
                            bring any beast, his brothers and son are to be beaten. Also in the
                            morning we will break open the water in Kolaṃte's <span class="bibit">tam̄a</span>. Now
                            there is need of more water here.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: Read presumably (R. 1) <span class="bibit">Kolaṃtesa tam̄aṃmi</span> Kolaṃte appears elsewhere as a proper name. The word <span class="bibit">tam̄aṃmi</span> is obscure. The only thing like it which occurs is <span class="bibit">tam̄ena</span>, a title or surname of Suḡ́ita. That brings us little nearer.<br>
              <span class="bibit">aco</span> seems to be a kind of frontier post. The functions of the <span class="bibit">acovina</span> seems to be much the same as those of the <span class="bibit">sṕasavaṃna</span>. Compare, for instance, 126 with 139.<br>

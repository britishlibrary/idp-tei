              His majesty, etc. . . . Śakā complains that Molýina has received land in
                            his estate (<span class="bibit">kilmeyaṃmi</span>) The <span class="bibit">śadavidas</span> and
                                <span class="bibit">karsenav́as</span> encroach on it and do not allow him to
                            cultivate. They cut the trees off it and sell them. It is not right for
                            people to cut down other people's property. When this wedge and seal
                            reach you, forthwith you must make careful investigation with oath and
                            witness, whether it is really so. The <span class="bibit">śadavidas</span> and
                            <span class="bibit">karsenav́as</span> are to be stopped from that (so that) they
                            do not encroach on Śaka. The former legal arrangement is that whoever
                            cuts down trees with the roots is to be prevented (as regards) the trees
                            (still) existing, and the penalty is (a fine of ) a horse. If he cuts
                            off the boughs (<span class="bibit">lada</span>) of a tree, he is to be punished by
                            the fine of a cow. A decision is to be made according to law, etc. . . .<br>

            <br>
            
              This document concerning a payment from Lýipeya is to be carefully kept
                            by Suḡ́uda.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Taṃjaka.<br>
              In the 17th year of his majesty the great king Mayiri, son of heaven, in the
                            first month, 22nd day, in this reign, it happened that the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Cakvala brought a man called Cmaǵa from Caḍ́ota.
                            This man Cmaǵa the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kolýis̱a took. He sold him to
                            Lýipeya. Lýipeya arose and sold that man Cmaǵa to Suǵuta of Caḍ́ota.
                            The price received was one camel three years old, five
                                <span class="bibit">milima</span> of corn, one <span class="bibit">kośava</span>,one
                                <span class="bibit">namata</span>, and one <span class="bibit">avaliḱa</span>. After that the
                            master of that man Cmaǵa, Kuv́ayici of Parvata came forth. They brought
                            an action at the king's court. That man Cmaǵa was the property of
                            Kuv́ayici. The price (paid for him) was to be received (back) by Lýipeya
                            from the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Cakvala, and by Suḡ́uda from Lýipeya. From
                            Lýipeya (the amount paid back) was a camel three years old, <span class="bibit">5
                                milima</span> of corn, 1 <span class="bibit">kośava, 1 namata</span>, 1
                                <span class="bibit">avaliḱa</span>. As regards other additional
                                (? <span class="bibit">orovaġa</span>) payment, on account of this Lýipe gave to
                            Suḡ́uta one camel seven years old. They made a decision. From now on the
                            question of this payment is not to be brought up a second time with
                            Suḡ́uta and Sunaṃda, or Lýipe and Lýipatġa. Witnesses to this are the
                            magistrate in charge of the province, the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Taṃjaka,
                            the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Alýaya, (his) son Ardharasa, and the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Ūgra. It was written by me the state scribe
                                (<span class="bibit">raja divira</span>) the monk Dham̄apriya. It has authority in
                            all places.<br>

              This hand-letter concerning a vineyard of Ḍhamaj́a is to be carefully
                            preserved by the scribe Ramṣotsa.<br>
              In the 6th year of the reign of the
                            great king, etc. . . . . Aṃkvaǵa, son of heaven, in the 4th month,
                            14th day, there is a man called Ḍhamaśa, and a second, the scribe
                            Ramṣotsa. They made a buying and selling in a time of drought, a time of
                            famine. These are both natives (<span class="bibit">kilmeci</span>) of Yav́e av́ana. So
                            this Ḍhamaja arose and sold to the scribe Ramṣotsa a vineyard consisting
                            in all of seven <span class="bibit">avacira</span>. The price given was carpet
                                (<span class="bibit">tavastaǵa) six</span> hands long, one <span class="bibit">kavaj́i</span>,
                            two sheep, and one <span class="bibit">milima</span> of corn. They agreed on equal
                            terms in front of the magistrates <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> Piteya and
                                <span class="bibit">kala</span> Karaṃtsa. Witnesses are the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span>
                            V́arpa, the <span class="bibit">karsenav́a</span> Saluv́eya, the <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Cato,
                            and the attendant Ariṣṕa. In this vineyard the scribe Ramṣotsa has
                            ownership to present it to others, to exchange it, and to enjoy it in
                            every way whatever is wanted to be done. Whoever at a future time
                            informs, disputes, or disagrees (about this matter), his bringing up
                            again of the matter shall be without authority at the king's court. This
                            hand-letter was written by me the scribe Moǵata, son of the scribe
                            Tamasṕa. Its authority is a thousand years, as long as life.<br>
              The <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Molýina by name cut the string.<br>

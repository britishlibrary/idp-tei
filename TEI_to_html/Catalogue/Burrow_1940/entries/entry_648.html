              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              In the 8th year of his majesty the great king, the king of kings, the
                            great, the victorious, the just king Pepiya, son of heaven, it is in
                            this reign that has come about in the succession of kings. There is a
                            man called Tameya, and (another) called Parsuǵe. They (and) their
                            fathers arose and sold land to Vum̄eya. The price, one horse, was taken.
                            It is said to be <span class="bibit">vito</span>. In that land the capacity for seed
                            is one <span class="bibit">milima</span>. They agreed on equal terms in front of the
                            magistrates <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Cateya and <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span>
                            Piteya. Witnesses to it are the <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> Aṃto, the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Siǵayita, and the <span class="bibit">śadavidas</span>
                            Napuǵi and Ṣamoǵata. The deed was written by me the scribe Apǵeya at the
                            command of the magistrates. Its authority is as long as life.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: <span class="bibit">Nuava</span> is presumably short for <span class="bibit">mahanuava</span> = <span class="bibit">mahānubhāva</span>. But it is curious that it should occur no less than three times (648, 655, 656) in the few documents of Pepiya.<br>

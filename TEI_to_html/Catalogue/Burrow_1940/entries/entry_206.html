              To his dear father <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Opǵeya, etc. . . . the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span> Dham̄apala, etc. . . . thus (writes): A letter
                            went from here (with instructions that) your son Apita was to bring
                            the wine here along with Sujata. Sujata came here, but you kept this
                            Apita back there; the wine and the rest of the tax you did not send
                            here. They are causing Sujata a great deal of trouble here on account of
                            Aputa. Also they wanted to search for this Aputa here. I made an appeal
                            at the feet of his majesty. As a result he was allowed (?). Now indeed
                            it is to be made ready. The year's tax in Ayamatu Vasa is to be brought
                            here by him. If it is kept back further in Ayamatu Vasa, let not (?), do
                            not blame me.<br>

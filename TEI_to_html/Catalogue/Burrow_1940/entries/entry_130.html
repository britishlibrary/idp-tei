              To dear brother <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Lýipeya.<br>
              At the feet of his dear brother <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Lýipeya, dear to men
                            and gods, of pleasant aspect, <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Taṃjaka pays respect,
                            and sends the health of his divine body, much, very much; and thus (he
                            writes), namely: The <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kolýis̱a and the
                                <span class="bibit">śramana</span> Śriguda have exchanged (?) men. Yoǵas̱ena has
                            become the property of <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kolýis̱a, (but) with Śriguta
                            there is no [? ?. . . . ] now it is heard that there [. . .]
                            cultivation, Yoǵasena [. . . . ] ? the man is not to be sold along with
                            (it). Yoǵasena, the original debt (?) [. . . ] is the property of [. .
                            .]. You must act according to the law of the world
                                (<span class="bibit">lokadharma</span>). Also whatever work has been done by
                            Taṃcǵe must certainly be brought to my knowledge. Instructions must be
                            given to Taṃcǵe that he shall (?) the right quantity of wine.<br>

              Note: The document is too imperfectly preserved to be understood properly. In U.O. 3 reading <span class="bibit">parivaṭitaṃti</span> for <span class="bibit">pariviṭitaṃti</span> makes good sense. <span class="bibit">parivaṭ-</span> is used elsewhere in the documents in the sense of "exchange". In U.O. 7 the alternative <span class="bibit">s̱adha</span> seems better than <span class="bibit">s̱arva</span>. The verb <span class="bibit">pariśamiśati</span> is obscure.<br>

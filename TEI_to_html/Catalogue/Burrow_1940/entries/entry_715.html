              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              In the 24th year, 11th month, 25th day of the reign of his majesty the
                            great king Aṃgvaka, son of heaven, there are two men, a father and son,
                            arrow makers, Moǵata Cimola and Moǵeya Moc̄h́a. They arose [. . .] and
                            sold <span class="bibit">miṣiya</span>-land with a capacity for seed of three
                                <span class="bibit">milima</span>. Moǵeta Cimola and Moǵeya Moc̄h́a received as
                            price one nine years old camel. They agreed on equal terms before the
                            magistrates. In that land the <span class="bibit">śadavita</span> Riciḱǵa has
                            ownership, to sow, to plough, to give to another as a present, to do
                            whatever he likes with it. Whoever at a future time finds fault with
                            this before the <span class="bibit">v́asus</span> and <span class="bibit">aǵetas</span> at the king's
                            court, shall be without authority. Witnesses to this are the
                                <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> V́arpa, the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Karaṃtsa, the
                                <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Acuñiya, the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Kuuna, the
                                <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Cato, the <span class="bibit">karsenav́a</span> Vukiṃtǵa,
                            Taṃcǵo, the <span class="bibit">trigha</span> Cakvala, the <span class="bibit">vuryaǵa</span>
                            Ratǵeya, and the <span class="bibit">karsenav́a</span> Śapuǵa. This hand-written deed
                            was written by the scribe Ramṣotsa, son of the scribe Siǵnaya, at the
                            command of the magistrates. Also the arrow makers Moǵata and Moǵeya [. . .<br>

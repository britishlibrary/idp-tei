              His majesty, etc. . . . The <span class="bibit">kala</span> Puṃñabala informs us that
                            there a man called Kunǵeya is ploughing lands in Navaǵa av́ana. And so
                            he has taken from the farm. If this wedge and seal arrive there,
                            forthwith careful investigation is to be made with oath and witness,
                            (and) if it is really so, these lands are to be handed over to the
                            people of Navaǵa av́ana as their property. As regards the [. . .] of

              Also Poniǵana informs us: There is no <span class="bibit">juṭhi</span> seed of mine
                            with my mother. A <span class="bibit">milima</span> of corn is to be given to Saru. He
                            will do the sowing. Also there is no <span class="bibit">juṭhi</span> seed here. The
                            land has been watered. Millet seed is to be sent from there, two or
                            three <span class="bibit">milima</span>.<br>
              Also Kari informs us: Corn there has been
                            given by me to the community of monks, <span class="bibit">milima</span> five
                                <span class="bibit">ac̄h́aniya</span>. If this Sutaṣa comes there, this corn is to
                            be collected and handed over to Saṃgos̱a, (to the extent of) five
                                <span class="bibit">milima</span> two <span class="bibit">khi</span>, <span class="bibit">ṣamiyena</span>.<br>
              Also Poniǵana and Kaci point out that the monk Anaṃdasena has made (?) to go there. If
                            he comes there, by all means care is to be exercised in the maintenance
                                of his body, to live (<span class="bibit">civ́anae</span>) and as far
                            as there is security for life, not to die. The <span class="bibit">ṣamiyena</span>
                            corn is to be given to Saṃghosa.<br>

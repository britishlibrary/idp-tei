              This document concerning a vineyard (bought) from Budhila and Budhaya is
                            to be carefully preserved by [. . .] and Saṃǵaśri.<br>
              This is the seal of the monks Śaṃca, Sujata, and Dhamila. In the 28th year, 11th month,
                            13th day in the reign of the great king Jiṭugha Aṃkvaǵe, son of heaven,
                            at this time Budhila and secondly Budhaya (two) of the sons of the
                                <span class="bibit">śramaṃna</span> Aṭhamo arose. They sold a vineyard of four
                                <span class="bibit">apcira</span>, and another piece of <span class="bibit">letǵa kuthala</span>
                            land in the <span class="bibit">miṣi</span>-(land). The whole amount is five (pieces
                            of land). Anaṃda bought it and paid the price, 1 golden stater and
                            another 2 <span class="bibit">muli</span>, and a later amount of 12 <span class="bibit">muli</span>.
                            They agreed on equal terms. It was well bought and well sold. This was
                            written in the presence of the bhikṣu-saṅgha at Caḍ́ota, at the request
                            of Budhila and Budhaya. Witnesses were: the monk Budharac̄h́i, elder of
                            the saṅgha, the monk Yipiya [. . . ] the monk, and <span class="bibit">daśavida</span>
                            Śaṃca, the monk Dham̄amitra [. . . ] the monk Dham̄a[kama], the servant
                            of the reverend Ridhasena, Ciǵita, and the monks Tsaǵirsta and Śanaǵa.
                            This was written at the command of the bhikṣu-saṅgha by me the scribe
                            Apǵeya, and at the command of Budhila and Budhaya. Its authority is for
                            a thousand years, as long as life. Whoever at a future time shall bring
                            up arguments (in an attempt) to alter it, he shall have no authority in
                            front of the bhikṣu-saṅgha. The fine (for such an attempt) is five
                            pieces of cloth, and the punishment (<span class="bibit">dhaṃta</span> = daṇḍa) fifty
                            strokes.Thus carefully (its) authority (is fixed). There is no end.<br>
              The monk Budhavam̄a and the monk Bhatra are witnesses.<br>

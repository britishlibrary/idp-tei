              This receipt concerning a vineyard of Ḍhamaśa is to be carefully kept by
                            the scribe Ramṣotsa.<br>
              In the 16th year of the reign of his majesty the
                            great king Aṃkvaǵa, son of heaven, in the 6th month, 1st day, there is a
                            man called Ḍhamaśa. He arose and sold to the scribe Ramṣotsa a vineyard
                            along with the trees consisting of fifteen <span class="bibit">sujada</span>. The
                            price given was one horse. They agreed and made a decision. In that
                            vineyard from now on the scribe Ramṣotsa has ownership, to prop, to
                            knock down, to cut the grapes, drink (the wine), to exchange, to sell,
                            to do whatever he likes with. They made a decision in front of the
                            magistrates <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> V́arpa and <span class="bibit">kala</span> Karaṃtsa.
                            Witnesses are Acuñiya, the <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Caḍhiya, the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Kuraǵeya, the <span class="bibit">śadavita</span> Pakvaya,
                            the <span class="bibit">karsenav́a</span> Tsaroka, the <span class="bibit">śadavita</span> Moǵata,
                            the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Taṃjika, the <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Śronǵa,
                            the <span class="bibit">śadavida</span> Pursavara, and the <span class="bibit">vuryaǵa</span>
                            Ratǵeya. Whoever at a future time informs, disputes, or disagrees, his
                            bringing up again of the matter shall be without authority at the king's
                            court. This receipt was written by me the scribe Moǵata, son of the
                            scribe Tamasṕa, at the command of the magistrates. Its authority is a
                            hundred years, as long as life. They made a decision here in the
                                <span class="bibit">paraṃpula</span> of Caḍ́ota. This was written at the request
                            of Ḍhamaj́a. The <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Caḍhiya by name cut the string.<br>

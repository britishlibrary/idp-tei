              This document concerning property received from Pitǵa is tube carefully
                            preserved by the scribe Sunaṃta.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Moǵi and Pitǵa. In the 20th year of his majesty the
                            great king Jiṭugha Mayiri, son of heaven, in the 10th month, 17th day,
                            in this reign, there is a man Pitǵa. He has a claim against the scribe
                            Sunaṃta. Now Pitǵa and the scribe Suḡ́aṃta have made a settlement; they
                            have agreed. The scribe Sunaṃta has paid the whole debt; Pitǵa has
                            received it. From now on Pitǵa has no claim for payment from Sunaṃta,
                            and is not to take possession. Witnesses there are the noble people
                            (namely), the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Moǵiya, the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Kaḱeya and
                            Jeyaka, the <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Catuǵeya, the monk Saṃgharac̄h́i, Pleya,
                            and Dhameca.<br>

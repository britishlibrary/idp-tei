              To his dear brother <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Lýimsu, etc. . . . Kupṣiṃta sends
                            health, etc. . . . and thus (he says) namely: There is corn belonging to
                            me there on loan. Of you Seṃniǵa and Suḡ́ita [. . . . ] I say. He says
                            there are two instalments of interest. There you must not take (an
                            additional) year. That interest which there is consists of two
                            instalments of interest. You know (?) about the corn of [. . . .]na and
                            Seṃniǵa. Also I have sent this Caṃpe there. What corn [. . . .] is with
                            [. . . . ] let it all be investigated. Again the corn from
                                <span class="bibit">paniṃcana</span>, that corn is in the hand of Saṃghas̱ena.
                            Saṃghas̱ena says that that corn has not been written down on the receipt
                            together with (the other items). By all means let Saṃghas̱ena make a
                            reckoning of this corn together with (the other). By all means he must
                            be told to inquire into the corn from the <span class="bibit">[ma]rava[ra]</span>
                            Kunǵeya. Also whatever corn in your hand [?] in Saṃghas̱ena's hand
                            [?].<br>

              This document concerning a theft by Kacano (slave) of Saṃgila is to be
                            carefully kept by Larsu.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">cozbos</span> Iṃdras̱ena and
                            Kirtisam̄a.<br>
              In the ninth year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Vaṣmana, son of
                            heaven, on the 19th day of the 3rd month, at this date the
                                <span class="bibit">ogus</span> Asuraǵa, Piteya, Rohana, Jayaśa, Kirtisam̄a, and
                            Ldas̱a, the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Takra, the <span class="bibit">caṃkura</span> Purnadana
                            and the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Mitrapala heard (a case). Larsu reported,
                            "property of mine was lost and was recovered from Kacano, slave of
                            Saṃgila." (The property consisted of):<br>
              One embroidered <span class="bibit">vidapa</span>; a jacket made of white silk; a
                                <span class="bibit">saṃiṃna</span>; a <span class="bibit">lýokmana</span> of many colours; a
                            yellow-coloured <span class="bibit">kuv́ana</span>-garment; a jacket made of hempen
                            cloth; a <span class="bibit">kharav́arna</span> garment; an embroidered
                                <span class="bibit">lýokmana</span>; a <span class="bibit">kremeru</span>; a
                                <span class="bibit">paliyarnaǵa</span> garment; four golden <span class="bibit">dare</span>; one
                                <span class="bibit">varṣaǵa</span>; five <span class="bibit">hasta</span> of woollen cloth; two
                            blue-dyed <span class="bibit">kiǵi</span>. These objects are valued at [. . .] all the
                            property has been recovered.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: This document is treated by Lüders, <span class="bibit">Textilien</span>, pp. 29, 30.<br>
              For <span class="bibit">vi da pa na da śpa ta</span> read <span class="bibit">vidapa</span> 1
                                <span class="bibit">śpeta</span>. For <span class="bibit">petavaṃnidaǵa</span> Lüders suggests
                                <span class="bibit">pitavº</span> "yellow-coloured"; but an examination of the
                            original does not bear this out. For <span class="bibit">prahuni</span>, perhaps
                                <span class="bibit">prahoni</span> should be read. <span class="bibit">Ṣaṃnapaṭamae</span>
                            should be read instead of <span class="bibit">ṣaṃnapaṭa maha</span> (Lüders, loc.
                            cit.). Many terms still remain obscure; of <span class="bibit">ṣamiṃna</span>,
                                <span class="bibit">lýokmana</span>, <span class="bibit">kremeru</span>,
                                <span class="bibit">paliyarnaǵa</span>, <span class="bibit">dare</span>, <span class="bibit">kiǵi</span>
                            nothing is known. <span class="bibit">Varṣaǵa</span> is perhaps the same thing as
                            appears elsewhere as <span class="bibit">hastavarṣaǵa</span>. The term
                                <span class="bibit">uṃna</span> is taken as = Skt. <span class="bibit">ūrṇa</span> "wool",
                            though usually the group <span class="bibit">rn</span> is preserved.<br>

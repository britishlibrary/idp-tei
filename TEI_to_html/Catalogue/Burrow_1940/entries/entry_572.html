              This letter concerning <span class="bibit">kuthala</span> received from Siǵnaya is to be
                            carefully kept by Kuñita.<br>
              In the 21st year, 6th month, 13th day in the
                            reign of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Aṃǵoka, son of heaven, there
                            is a man, the scribe Siǵnaya. He arose and gave to his neighbour Kuñita
                            ten <span class="bibit">kuthala</span> for growing barley (?) in <span class="bibit">miṣi</span>-land. (The
                            transaction) was in the presence of the magistrates
                                <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> V́arpa and <span class="bibit">kala</span> Karaṃtsa. The
                            witnesses were the <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span> Kuv́aya, Kaṃjiya, the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Kleṃjiya, Suǵnuta, and the <span class="bibit">apsu</span>
                            Śāṃcā. From now on Kuñita has ownership in that <span class="bibit">kuthala</span> to
                            sow, plough, and do whatever he likes with it. Whoever at a future time
                            shall bring the matter up again, his bringing up again of the matter
                            shall be without authority at the king's court. This was written by me the scribe Mogata at the command of the
                            magistrates. Its authority is as long as life.<br>
              Those <span class="bibit">kuthala</span> are in Yaṣala straight from Suryada (?). As
                            given, it has been well given. Kuñita has received and received well.<br>

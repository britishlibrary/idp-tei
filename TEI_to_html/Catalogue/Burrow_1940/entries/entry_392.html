              To his dear brother <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka dear to men and gods, the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Kolýis̱a pays his respects and sends the health
                            of his divine body, much, very much. And thus (he says): Now they have
                            brought twenty royal camels from the king's court. [They are] very ill.
                            We conducted the <span class="bibit">pracukamaṃ nagara</span> from this kingdom to the
                            open lands (<span class="bibit">laṭhanami</span>) They came here. (When) this letter
                            reaches you, forthwith quickly you must send people. The
                                <span class="bibit">pracukamaṃ nagara</span> are to be brought into the enclosed
                            lands (<span class="bibit">kabhoḍhaṃmi</span>). Pǵena went to the mountain. Kuuna
                            brought the camels there<br>
            <br>

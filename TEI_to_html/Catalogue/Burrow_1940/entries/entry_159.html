              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              Also a letter of command has come here from the king's court, that from
                            there, from Saca the ghee from the royal cows is to be unloaded from the
                            Caḍ́otan beasts and abandoned (?) when the Caḍotan Kupṣu arrives there
                            [. . .<br>
            <br>
          <br>
          <span class="notheader">Section: Rev.</span><br>
            
              From there I hear nothing from you and the authorities. Considering
                            this fact I have now sent two jars in the hand of the
                            <span class="bibit">śadavida</span> Kolýis̱a. One is to be delivered to Sacha and
                            the other taken to Caḍ́ota. When he brings them there, immediately one
                            jar is to be quickly sent to Caḍ́ota, and a document of account is to be
                            quickly brought to my knowledge (telling) how much this year's ghee is.
                            At whatever day of the month a letter of command goes there concerning
                            the ghee, at that time the ghee is to be quickly sent here to the king's
                            court. Do not allow any slackness here. This letter has been forwarded
                            through a series of people, so do not mind about a present.<br>

              Concerning sheep from Kapǵeya, to be kept by Suḡ́uta.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka.<br>
              In the 11th year of the great king
                            Jiṭuga Mairi, son of heaven, in the 2nd month, 9th day, in this reign.
                            Suḡ́uta and Kapǵe made an agreement outside (the court). I Kapǵeya give
                            ten sheep to Suḡ́uta as his property. Suḡ́uta shall have ownership over
                            the sheep, to do what he likes with them. Whoever at a future time
                            raises the question (again) of these sheep [he shall be without]
                            authority, and a penalty will be incurred. Witnesses to this are the
                                <span class="bibit">toṃga</span> Vuǵato, the <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Opǵeya. (It was
                            written) at the request of Kapǵeya. Its authority is as long as life.<br>

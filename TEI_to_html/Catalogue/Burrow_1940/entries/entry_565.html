              Note: The present document is translated and discussed in detail by
                            Lüders in his essay "<span class="bibit">Zur Geschichte des Ostasiatischen Tier kreises</span>", to
                            which the student is referred. The present translation is substantially
                            the same as his except for A. 4, where he has misunderstood

                            obscure. Lüders' suggestion that it = Pk. <span class="bibit">luhai</span> (meaning

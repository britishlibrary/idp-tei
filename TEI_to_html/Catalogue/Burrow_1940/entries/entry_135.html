              His majesty, etc. . . . Now the <span class="bibit">cuv́alayina</span> Ph́um̄as̱eva has
                            had to go on a mission to Khotan. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches
                            you, straightaway this Apita must go on the mission, and the
                            <span class="bibit">cuv́alayina</span> Ph́um̄as̱eva must go with him to Khotan. As
                            regards the two express camels of <span class="bibit">cuv́alayina</span> Ph́um̄as̱eva,
                            they must be given (him), (likewise) the one camel of Apita must be
                            given (him). Also a suitable man is to be given them as guide
                                (<span class="bibit">arivaǵa</span>), who will go in front of them. This guide
                            must go on his own beast. Just as formerly you have provided fodder and
                            water for envoys, so now they are to be given to these envoys.<br>

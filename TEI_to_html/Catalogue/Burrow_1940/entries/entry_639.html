              His majesty, etc. . . The <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Azuraka informs us that there
                            the Caḍ́otans belonging to the <span class="bibit">kilme</span> of the
                                <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Azuraka go from here. You occupy the road and keep
                            them back a long time. If they go on their own initiative, they demand a
                            cow from them as recompense (for using) the bridge. This is not the
                            previously existing law that the road of <span class="bibit">asmāti</span> people
                            should be occupied. When a letter <span class="bibit">of</span> command comes to you
                            from here (saying) that the road is to be blocked and the bridge seized,
                            at that time it is to be blocked and the bridge is to be seized. As
                            long, however, as a letter <span class="bibit">of</span> command (to that effect) does
                            not come from here, the road is to be left open in peace to the
                            Caḍ́otans. The cow (demanded as) recompense for (using) the bridge is
                            not to be relinquished.<br>

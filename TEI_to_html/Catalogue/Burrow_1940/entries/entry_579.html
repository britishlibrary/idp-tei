              This receipt concerning land of Moǵata is to be carefully preserved by
                            the scribe Ramṣotsa.<br>
              In the 9th year of the reign of the great king, the
                            king of kings, the great, the victorious, the just, abiding in the true
                            law, his majesty the great king Aṃkvaǵa, son of heaven, in the 6th
                            month, 15th day, there is a man the secret agent Moǵata by name. He arose
                            and sold <span class="bibit">akri</span> land to the scribe Ramṣotsa with a capacity
                            for seed of one <span class="bibit">milima</span> ten <span class="bibit">khi</span> of 
                            <span class="bibit">aḍ́iṃni</span>. The price received was thirteen hands of carpet valued
                            at twelve. So the scribe Ramṣotsa has ownership over this land, to sow,
                            to plough, to give as a present to another, to enjoy in all ways
                            whatever is wanted to be done. They made this buying and selling in
                            front of the magistrates. Witnesses to it are the royal administrator,
                            the <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> Piteya, the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Karaṃtsa, the
                                <span class="bibit">apsus</span> Apṣiya, and Śāṃcā; others beside (are) the
                                <span class="bibit">togha</span> Kuv́aya, the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Caḍhi, the
                                <span class="bibit">apsu</span> Karaṃtsa, the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Lustu, the
                                <span class="bibit">vuryaǵa</span> Pǵeta, the <span class="bibit">tsaghinav́a</span> Kapota, and
                            Śirāsa the attendant of the <span class="bibit">kori</span> Ṣṕalýaya. Whoever at a
                            future time informs or disputes bout this, his bringing up again of the
                            matter shall be without authority at the king's court. This receipt was
                            written by me the scribe Moǵata, son of the scribe Tamasṕa at the
                            command of the magistrates. Its authority is a thousand years, as long
                            as life.<br>
              The attendant of the <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span>, Śronǵa, and the
                                <span class="bibit">karsenav́a</span> Śodinǵa cut the string.<br>

              To be opened by my dear brother-in-law, <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span>
                            Lýipeya.<br>
              To his dear brother-in-law <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Lýipeya of pleasant
                            aspect, beloved of men and gods, glorified by a good name Kupṣiṃta pays
                            respect and sends the health of his divine body, much, immeasurable, and
                            thus (he says): [. . . . ] Campeya. Do not keep back there Nataśrṛmi and
                            Aṣḍhaya. Everything in your knowledge [. . .] instruction. With him
                            Caṃpeya must come here along with Naṃtaśrṛmā. When you are going to
                            travel down to the king's court, let me hear about the month and day. I
                            must be informed. Also of us here at the king's court [. . .]. If you
                            are going down to the king's court, take care (<span class="bibit">su[ṭha]</span>) to
                            let me hear (about it). If you are not going, let me hear too. You gave
                            instructions about a horse. Campeya will bring the horse there later
                                (<span class="bibit">pac̄a</span>). You have told him to hand it over here. Do not
                            neglect to do this. The hire of the camel is one <span class="bibit">arnavaj́i</span>
                            eight <span class="bibit">hastas</span> long. I have sent it there in the hand of
                            Naṃtaśrṛma. The <span class="bibit">arnavaj́i</span> is white. As regards the
                            ploughing, barley, wheat, and <span class="bibit">aḍ́iṃni</span> is to be carefully [.
                            . . . .] looked after by you. Also Lýivrasma must by all means be
                            zealous about it. We have sent a present. Sarpinae's present is one [. .
                            . ? . . .]. Also let Lýivrasma make a reckoning of how much grain they
                            use there in sowing on the ploughed land.<br>

              Notes: <span class="bibit">hali</span> in the phrase <span class="bibit">hali kariṣyasi</span> is
                            obscure. But the meaning is roughly clear. He is telling him to keep to
                            his promise to send a horse . Is it Skt. <span class="bibit">alīka</span> "false?" The
                            language is somewhat irregular as regards <span class="bibit">h</span> (<span class="bibit">Grammar</span>, §
                            28).<br>

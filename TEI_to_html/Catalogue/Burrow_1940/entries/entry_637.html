            <br>
            
              In the 11th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭuga Mayiri, son of
                            heaven, on the first day of the sixth month, at the time the queen made
                            a journey to Khotan, at that time the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Kirteya came
                            here to Caḍ́ota and made <span class="bibit">vaṣḍhiǵa</span> in the mountain, in the
                            time of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka. At that time (the following)

                                (<span class="bibit">aṭa</span>) 1 <span class="bibit">milima</span> 5 <span class="bibit">khi</span>; further, as
                            provisions in the mountains <span class="bibit">1 milima</span> 10<span class="bibit">khi</span>.
                            Further, the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> fell ill and at that time the expenditure
                            of corn was 1 <span class="bibit">milima</span> 10 <span class="bibit">khi</span> in

                                <span class="bibit">acomena</span>. Further, the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Kirteya
                            returned from the mountain, and at that time the expenditure of wine in
                            Caḍ́ota, in the <span class="bibit">vaṣḍhika</span>, was 7 <span class="bibit">khi</span>. Further,

                                <span class="bibit">milima</span>, in all, and in addition they took 4 sheep along
                            with 4 <span class="bibit">milima</span> of corn. Further, (when) the

                            Nina and took 4 <span class="bibit">khi</span> of wine <span class="bibit">potǵoñena</span>.
                            Further, from there a letter of command came from the feet of the

                            the <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Ḍhapǵeya. Further, we took a present of
                                3 <span class="bibit">khi</span> of wine <span class="bibit">potǵoñena</span> to the
                                <span class="bibit">śadavida</span> Tsuǵeṣla. Further, the <span class="bibit">kāla</span>
                            granted 1 <span class="bibit">milima</span> of corn to Yitaya. Further, from the feet
                            of the <span class="bibit">kāla</span>, <span class="bibit">soṃgha</span> was granted each year to the

                            of wine was 1 <span class="bibit">milima</span> 4 <span class="bibit">khi</span>, <span class="bibit">potǵoñena</span>.
                            Further, Saǵamoya, Priyavata, and Lýipeya took 12 <span class="bibit">khi</span> of
                            wine <span class="bibit">potǵoñena</span> to the Sācas. Further, 2 <span class="bibit">milima</span>
                            of corn was granted from the feet of the <span class="bibit">kala</span> to the
                            keepers of the camels. The camels went out to the sacrifices. Further,
                            Cikiṃto, the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Saǵamoya, Tuṃpala, and Cakola took 4
                                <span class="bibit">milima</span> of wine <span class="bibit">ṣamiyena</span> to the mountains.
                            Further, from a letter of presentation, 5 <span class="bibit">khi</span> went out to

                                <span class="bibit">khi</span> to Moǵeci.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: (2) <span class="bibit">dirpira</span> appears not to be a proper name here.<br>
              (3) The terms <span class="bibit">acona</span> and <span class="bibit">acomena</span> are quite obscure. They could be place names.<br>
              (10) The taking of wine to the mountains by Cikiṃto (Cǵito), Saǵamoya, and Cakola (Cakuv́ala) is mentioned also in No. 634.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . . Lýipeya complains that he has a dispute about a
                            child Apis̱ae adopted from Kunǵeya. When this sealed wedge-tablet
                            reaches you, forthwith you must carefully inquire in person with oath
                            and witness. According to the law of old recompense is paid for a child
                            adopted, and thus a decision is to be made. If it is different, etc. . .

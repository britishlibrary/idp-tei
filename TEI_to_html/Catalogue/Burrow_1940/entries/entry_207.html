              (4) Another parcel belonging to Tsuǵelva is 2 <span class="bibit">milima</span> of
                            corn; by Kalýiǵeya [. . .<br>
              (5) The sum of the arrears is: The new and the old ghee 18
                            <span class="bibit">khi</span>, 1 <span class="bibit">asaṃkharaj́iya</span> (?), 6 rugs
                            (<span class="bibit">kośava</span>), 1 <span class="bibit">akiṣḍha</span>, 5 pieces of cloth, 16
                            <span class="bibit">kamuṃta</span>, 3 sacks, 3 baskets, I sheep, 1
                            <span class="bibit">milima</span> 5 <span class="bibit">khi</span> of wine

            <br>
            
              Note: Read <span class="bibit">oǵana</span> in R. 3 for <span class="bibit">[a]ǵa</span> 1. It is some kind of agricultural commodity, found in other documents measured in <span class="bibit">milima</span> and <span class="bibit">khi</span>. For <span class="bibit">kalýiǵe vini</span>, the alternative (n. 6) <span class="bibit">Kalýiǵeyena</span> is to be preferred; it is the Instr. S. of the <span class="bibit">Kalýiǵeyas̱a</span> mentioned above. For <span class="bibit">potǵoñe</span> 1 read (as alternative n. 10) <span class="bibit">potǵoñena</span>. This is the form that occurs in the same connection elsewhere. Its meaning has not yet been determined.<br>
              This document is also treated by Lüder (<span class="bibit">BSOS.</span>, viii, 642; <span class="bibit">Textilien APAW.</span>, 1936, p. 6). A number of the commodities cannot be identified with certainty; namely <span class="bibit">oǵana</span> restored above, <span class="bibit">akiṣḍha</span> some woven material, <span class="bibit">sap.ǵa</span> which since it occurs nowhere else cannot be fully restored, and <span class="bibit">kamuṃta</span>. Lüders (<span class="bibit">Textilien</span>, p. 6, n.) identifies <span class="bibit">kamuṃta</span> with <span class="bibit">kamaṃta</span> (272, 714, preceded by <span class="bibit">caṃdri</span>), and quotes Schaeder and Henning who compare N.Pers. <span class="bibit">kamand</span> "noose". Bailey also draws attention to Saka <span class="bibit">kāṃmadi</span>. It is not, however, certain that the two are identical.<br>

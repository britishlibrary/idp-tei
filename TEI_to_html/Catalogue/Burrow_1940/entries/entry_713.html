              To the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Lýipeya. . . . . the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Taǵira,
                            etc. . . . And thus I inform you. Now they have performed
                            here an unprecedented action, unseen before. This unprecedented action
                            has resulted in everything being decided. The warriors (?) have taken
                            everything. What with the people they have slain in battle and those
                            they have captured alive, everything has been decided. Only to hear this
                            you will be exceedingly pleased. Also I make known to you that there in
                            Ajiyama Av́ana, there are too many lands. Here again the
                                <span class="bibit">kilmeṃciye</span> inform us that the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Kaṃcaǵa
                            does not receive what is right. He gives useless lands to others. I am
                            providing the <span class="bibit">maḱa</span> and <span class="bibit">oǵana</span> (due as) tax from
                            each of my own farms. This is not the law that others should plough the
                            lands of the village (<span class="bibit">av́ana</span>) and that I should provide our
                                <span class="bibit">maḱa</span> and <span class="bibit">oǵana</span> from my own farm, 
                            Now of me [. . .<br>

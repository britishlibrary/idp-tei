              On the seventh day of the sixth month, from the <span class="bibit">viṃśpa</span> of
                            Suḡ́uta, and the <span class="bibit">śata</span> of Cimǵe, one camel with its keeper
                            for <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span> Apeṃna, one camel with its keeper for Yapǵu.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: <span class="bibit">Śata</span> "hundred" occurs frequently as an administrative
                            division. <span class="bibit">Viṃśpa</span> which occurs here would seem to be
                            something similiar. It cannot in form correspond to the Sanskrit
                                <span class="bibit">viṃśa</span>, but could only represent <span class="bibit">viśva</span>,
                            which is unsuitable.<br>

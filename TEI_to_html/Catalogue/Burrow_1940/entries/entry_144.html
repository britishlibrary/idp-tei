              His majesty, etc. . . . Lýipeya informs us that he has a slave called
                            Kacana. Saǵana beat him. As a result of that beating the man Kacana died
                            on the eighth day. Here you, the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka received an
                            oral command that the witnesses had to swear an oath and that if Kacana
                            had died as a result of Soǵana's beating, a man was to be awarded as
                            recompense. Even so you pay no attention to this matter, and up to the
                            present day have made no decision. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches
                            you, forthwith an oath is to be sworn by the witnesses, and if Kacana
                            did no work after the beating [. . . ] died, a man is to be awarded as
                            recompense. If you are not clear [. . . ] written in a letter.<br>

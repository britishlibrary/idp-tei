                            camel from the herds is to be released. When this sealed wedge-tablet
                            reaches you, forthwith [. . .] likewise an <span class="bibit">aṃtaǵi</span> animal is
                            to be provided by the <span class="bibit">klaseṃcis</span>. Just as formerly an
                                <span class="bibit">aṃtaǵi</span> animal was provided by the
                                <span class="bibit">klaseṃcis</span>, so now it is to be provided. If it has not
                            been provided formerly it is not to be provided now.<br>

              This document concerning two camels from Raśpara, and concerning one
                            horse and a beating and whatever else has been falsely (? <span class="bibit">muṣa</span> =
                                <span class="bibit">mṛṣā</span>) taken from one another is to be carefully kept by the
                            scribe Suḡ́uta and Suḡ́aṃta.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena.<br>
              In the 20th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mayiri,
                            son of heaven, in the 10th month, 3rd day in this reign, the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena examined a dispute. Raśpara and the
                            scribe Suḡ́uta and Sunaṃta brought an action on a question of payment.
                            We decided that Suḡ́uta, Sunaṃta, the woman Sahiroae, and Kuñita should
                            swear an oath (lit. " eat an oath"). Raśpara arose and stopped (this).
                            He made a statement (<span class="bibit">saṃñati</span>) and did not allow them to
                            swear the oath. From now on concerning the two camels and the horse and
                            whatever else has falsely been taken from each other, and concerning the
                            beating, neither shall be entitled to any payment from the other.
                            Witnesses to this are the <span class="bibit">apsu</span> Vuǵto, the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span>
                            Moǵiya, the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Cakola, the <span class="bibit">korara</span>
                            Suḡ́ita, the <span class="bibit">ekhara</span> Motǵeya, the <span class="bibit">ageta</span>
                            Suḡ́iya, and the <span class="bibit">ari</span> Śarasṕa. This was written by me the
                            scribe Socara at the command of the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena. Its
                            authority is as long as life.<br>

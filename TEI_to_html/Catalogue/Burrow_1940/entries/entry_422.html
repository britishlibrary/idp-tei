              In the 3rd year, 7th month, 8th day of the great king, the king of kings
                            [. . . ], his majesty King Tajaka, the son of heaven — it is in his
                            reign. There is a man called Kuv́aya, son of the <span class="bibit">tasuca</span>
                            Oǵiya, and a second called Argiceya and his brothers Metroma, Cipitǵa,
                            and Mudhaütsa; they are all domiciled in Ajiyama av́ana. They arose, and
                            Argiceya and his brothers sold land to Kuv́aya. The capacity for seed of
                            the land is two <span class="bibit">milimas cuṭhiye</span>, two <span class="bibit">milimas</span>.
                            As price was taken from Kuv́aya one agiltsa camel. They agreed on equal
                            terms. There (the following) witnesses know of this. Of the Magistrates
                            (mahatvana) the <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Calaya, the <span class="bibit">apsu</span>
                            Vuǵina, the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Arcaka, the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaga</span>
                            Kustañaǵa, the scribes Tamasṕa and Siḍ́naya, the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span>
                            Tagu, the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Śirzata, the <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> Payina (?).
                            The thread was cut. The <span class="bibit">uyoǵa</span> was Piǵita by name. This
                            hand-written document was written by me the scribe Moǵeya, son of the
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaga</span> Moteǵa. Its authority is as long as life.<br>
            <br>
            
              Notes: This is the only document dated in the reign of King Tajaka. Since
                            it is removed from the other documents in date it is natural that it
                            should show traces of certain linguistic peculiarities. Of these we may
                            notice:—<br>
              (1) <span class="bibit">raj́a</span> king appears instead of the usual
                                <span class="bibit">raya</span>. On the treatment of <span class="bibit">-j-</span> see
                                <span class="bibit">Grammar</span>, § 17. The usual treatment is
                            <span class="bibit">y</span>.<br>
              (2) <span class="bibit">uṭh́a</span> for the usual <span class="bibit">uṭa</span> "camel". In this word <span class="bibit">ṭh́</span> does not
                            appear again, though in other words it appears regularly representing
                                <span class="bibit">-ṭṭh-</span>, e.g. <span class="bibit">vaṭh́ayaǵa</span> "attendant", and
                                <span class="bibit">kuṭh́ac̄h́ira</span>.<br>
              (3) In the native term <span class="bibit">agiltsa</span> we have a variant for what usually appears as
                                <span class="bibit">aṃklatsa</span>, a technical term denoting some kind of
                            camel.<br>
              (4) The genitive is almost invariably used instead of the
                            nominative. For this reason <span class="bibit">s̱arvaṣu</span> is probably to be
                            regarded as = <span class="bibit">sarveṣām</span>. The form is somewhat irregular, but
                            an <span class="bibit">e-</span> stroke may have been omitted by accident.<br>
              In line (4) read <span class="bibit">av́anaṃmi</span> instead of <span class="bibit">av́anaṃnci</span>
                            which is a misprint.<br>

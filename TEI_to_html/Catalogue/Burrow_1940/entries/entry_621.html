              His majesty, etc. . . Saǵamovi complains to this effect. He
                            is a native of Yav́e Av́ana. There is a potter (<span class="bibit">kulala</span>)
                            called Caṃca and this Saǵamovi is his son. A member of the
                                <span class="bibit">kilme</span> of the <span class="bibit">ogu</span> Aśoka, he used to dwell
                            when young next door to Cato. At that time Cato took to wife the
                            daughter of the <span class="bibit">śramana</span> Sundara, called Supriya. After that
                            this Saǵamovi and Supriyae fled from the house of Cato to the kingdom of
                            Kuci. They stayed a long time in the kingdom of Kuci. Then they came
                            back again to their own country through the influence of me the great
                            king [. . .]. Whatever this Saǵamovi had in the way of wives, sons,
                            daughters, and slaves, this Saǵamovi abandoned all claim to them. Now
                            the <span class="bibit">śramana</span> Sundara and Lýipana are causing trouble in Yav́e
                            Av́ana about the woman Supriyae. They are demanding a ransom
                                (<span class="bibit">lode</span>). When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you,
                            forthwith careful inquiry is to be made, whether it is true that the
                                <span class="bibit">śramana</span> Sundara and Lýipana are causing trouble to this
                            Saǵamovi about a ransom for Supriyae. They are to be stopped. They are
                            not to make claims to Supriyae against Saǵamovi.<br>

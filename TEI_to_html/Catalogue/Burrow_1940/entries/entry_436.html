            <br>
            
              This document, concerning a dispute with Ṣamas̱ena of Saca, is to be
                            carefully preserved by Maṣḍhiǵe. This is the seal of the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena. In the 19th year, 1st month, 25th day
                            of his majesty the great king Mahiri, son of heaven, in this reign, at
                            this time, there is a man, the <span class="bibit">śadavita</span> Maṣḍhiǵe. Ṣamas̱ena
                            of Saca and Karcika complained concerning a man Rutraya. They said that
                            as he was going on his way he was bound by Maṣḍhiǵe. Maṣḍhiǵe swore an
                            oath concerning that and went away cleared. Again they said that he had
                            been sold in Nina. Maṣḍhiǵe swore an oath a second time. Again a third
                            time Rutraya complained and lamented before the <span class="bibit">kitsayitsa</span>
                            Ṣayaṃma in Saca. On his account they again complained of kidnapping. The
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena decided this dispute. From now on
                            Ṣamas̱ena and Karcika have no claim on Rutraya against Maṣḍhiǵe. They
                            are not to take possession. There is to be no giving or taking.
                            Witnesses there are the noble people, the <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span> Vukto,
                            Paṃcina the magistrate in charge of the boundary (<span class="bibit">simici
                                mahatva</span>), Rage, Cakvala, Rutraya, Saǵapeya, the
                                <span class="bibit">tasuca</span> Cigha, Kacana, and the scribes Sunaṃta and
                            Socara. This was written by me, the scribe Veya at the command of the
                                <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: U.O. (5). The phrase <span class="bibit">paras̱ena muha rahitaṃti</span> is somewhat obscure. <span class="bibit">Rahitaṃti</span> is probably a mistake for *<span class="bibit">garahitaṃti</span>, as suggested by the editors in note 2. The word <span class="bibit">paras̱ena</span> is not a proper name (as it is considered in the <span class="bibit">Index Verborum</span>), but apparently the instrumental of the word <span class="bibit">paras̱a</span> which occurs frequently in the phrase <span class="bibit">paras̱a kritaṃti</span> meaning "carried off, plundered".<br>

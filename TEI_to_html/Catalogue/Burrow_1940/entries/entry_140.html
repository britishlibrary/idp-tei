              To be opened at the feet of the master and mistress <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span>
                            Lýipeya and Sarpinae.<br>
              Also there they are looking for gold. The gold [. . .]. I have sent
                            Tolayana of The Mountain there. By you, Lýimsu, attention is to be paid
                            to this matter and according to how much the price of gold is there,
                            this is to be sold.<br>
              To the feet of the masters, dear to men and gods, respected, of pleasant
                            aspect, whose life is a hundred years long of divine years suited to
                            them, dear brother-in-law <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Lýipeya, dear sister
                            Sarpinae and Suḡ́ita and Lýimsu, Kupṣiṃta pays respect and asks after
                            their good health and divine body, again and again, much, immeasurable;
                            and first of all I am pleased to hear that your divine body is in
                            health; I also am well through your favour and thus I address you: In
                            Lýimsu's hand there is some corn of mine on loan. As regards the
                            previous (lot) of corn, the <span class="bibit">vaṣḍhiǵaiṃ</span> (lot) which we
                            received here, you know the reckoning of it. The second lot is from the
                            ploughed field (and) you know the reckoning of it. It is in Saṃghas̱ena's
                            hand. The amount of that corn which has been used up or given to others,
                            has been entered on a tablet. The amount of corn remaining from that is
                            five <span class="bibit">milima</span> ten <span class="bibit">khi</span>. That corn is to be
                            demanded of Saṃghas̱ena along with interest. As regards the
                            <span class="bibit">vaṣḍhiǵaiṃ</span> corn, and the corn from the field, reckoning
                            is to be made separately. The corn from <span class="bibit">paniṃcana</span> is ten
                                <span class="bibit">khi</span>. A reckoning of that is to be made along with the
                            interest. As regards the previous corn, reckoning is to be made in
                            detail for each year individually. As regards last year's corn in
                            Caṃpe's hand, Kuteya knows how much came off the threshing floor. Also a
                            reckoning is to be made of the corn Campe has. Also you know the
                            reckoning of the wine which Kole has. Now there is room for some wine
                            from him. I have sent a present as token of remembrance, for you a
                                <span class="bibit">leśpa</span>, three <span class="bibit">sira</span> for each of you, and one
                                <span class="bibit">vatu</span> for Sarpinae.<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: <span class="bibit">vaṣḍhiǵaiṃ</span> (so read for <span class="bibit">vaṣṭ[u]ǵaiṃ</span>) is obviously a derivative with the <span class="bibit">-in-</span> suffix (<span class="bibit">Grammar</span>, § 77, <span class="bibit">cuv́alayina</span>, <span class="bibit">paṃcaraina</span>, etc.), from <span class="bibit">vaṣdhiǵa</span>. On <span class="bibit">iṃ</span> (i.e. <span class="bibit">in</span>) = <span class="bibit">ina</span> of <span class="bibit">Grammar</span>, § 13. The word <span class="bibit">vaṣḍhiǵa</span> which occurs in the phrase <span class="bibit">vaṣḍhiǵa karaṃnae</span> is unfortunately of uncertain meaning.<br>
              <span class="bibit">paniṃca ade</span> is the same word as appears <span class="bibit">kanicanade</span> (or <span class="bibit">pa.º</span>) in 100, a document dealing with the same matter as the present one. Read most probably <span class="bibit">paniṃcanade</span> in both cases. The word occurs nowhere else and there is nothing to indicate its meaning.<br>
              <span class="bibit">áyoga</span> meaning something which accrues, is added, can plausibly be rendered interest, since from 142 we see there was a rule that what was borrowed (<span class="bibit">avamici</span> as in this document) was to be paid back double.<br>

              Of their dear brother <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Ṣamas̱ena, of pleasant aspect,
                            dear to men and gods, whose life is a hundred divine years worthy of
                            him, famed with a good name, a divinity in person, the <span class="bibit">ogu</span>
                            Ciṃnaph́ara and the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Cinyaśa ask the health and
                            well-being, again and again, infinitely. For that reason we are pleased
                            in the first place (namely) that we have heard you are well. We also are
                            well; hearing that, you should be pleased. This is what we have to say:
                            You have sent a man Lýimǵeya here about the crows (?). In such a manner
                            we have learnt about everything. Certainly you do not do right if you
                            make a quarrel. As regards the blame of you which Kaḱeya, Lýipeya, and
                            Pośarsa have been expressing as a result of their hatred, we do not
                            believe it. At the same time you do not do right if you seek a quarrel
                            as a result of that. (?) the untruths from which trouble results for
                            you, in that case you have repeatedly besought us that we should prevent
                            them from (doing) that. Here we have prevented them. We have made a
                            letter of command from the royal office. A decision must be made from
                            the written letter which is in the hand of Ñimeya. If you do not agree,
                            they are to be sent here to the king's court under custody. As regards
                            the danger and alarm which (is reported) from the army, you must act in
                            such a way that you do not come to any misfortune, as a result of which
                            your ancestral name will be destroyed. You will become informed from the
                            communication which Lýimǵaya brings.<br>
              *    *   *<br>
              To the great <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Yitaka, of pleasing aspect, honoured by
                            men. and gods, famed with a good name, the <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Kuṣanas̱ena
                            sends health, much, immeasurable. I am pleased that we have heard of
                            good health of your body.I too am well; hearing that, you should be
                            pleased. And thus I write, namely: Everything is in your mind. A camel
                            is to be brought from you to me. You must not send a very old camel. For
                            that reason this <span class="bibit">stovaṃna</span> has been sent there to demand the
                            camel. When this <span class="bibit">stovaṃna</span> arrives there, having read the
                            letter, forthwith the camel is to be sent in the hand of the
                                <span class="bibit">stovaṃna</span> An old camel is not to be given. Let it be
                            such a camel as will cause the Khotanese to admire us. If you do not
                            send a camel as a result of this letter, then I will be annoyed
                                (<span class="bibit">parikleśami</span>) Again I have sent as a present one arrow
                                (<span class="bibit">kāḍa</span>).<br>
              *    *   *<br>
              Of their dear friend <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Naṃtas̱ena and Cataroyae, dear to
                            men and gods, famed with a good name and of infinitely pleasing aspect,
                            the monk Baṃgusena and Pacǵoyae, ask the health of their divine body,
                            much, immeasurable. And now here I have heard the bad news that Anas̱ena
                            is dead. As a result of that news we have experienced the shafts of
                            great sorrow and grief in our hearts. That is something beyond even the
                            powers of a Buddha, or a Pratyekabuddha, or an Arhant or a Universal
                            Monarch. All come to the same end. Care must be exercised how we go,
                            virtuous acts performed and purity maintained.<br>

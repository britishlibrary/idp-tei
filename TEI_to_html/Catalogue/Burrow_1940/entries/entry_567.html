              His majesty, etc. . . Suḡ́iya informs us that he has been a tax-gatherer
                                (<span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span>) for four years. Much has been wasted in his
                            house. Here in the wine-office a reckoning has-been made. The
                                <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃga</span> Suḡ́iya and Pǵis̱a owe wine to the extent of
                            150 <span class="bibit">milima</span>. When this sealed wedge-tablet reaches you,
                            immediately careful inquiry must be made. If this Suḡ́iya has wasted it
                            in his house, he is to be removed from his office of tax-gatherer.
                            Someone else is to be made tax-gatherer. The wine, the royal wine which
                            they owe to the wine department, this wine Suḡ́iya and Pǵis̱a must pay,
                            and the old wine is to be collected (by them). As regards the new wine,
                            Suḡ́iya has nothing to do with it. It is to be collected by the other
                            tax-gatherers.<br>

                            Lýipeya complains that in a troubled time Suḡ́iya took three
                                <span class="bibit">aṃbila</span> and one horse from his slave Paṭaya. When this

                            that Suḡ́i has taken them. He shall give (back) this man's property. If
                            it is otherwise, etc. . . .<br>

              Whoever performs the bathing of the <span class="bibit">Gaṇottama</span> becomes pure
                            in the eyes, bright, pure in the limbs, tender and of good
                            complexion.<br>
              Whoever performs the bathing of the
                                <span class="bibit">Gaṇottama</span> does not have boils and pimples,
                            elephantiasis, (?), or the itch. Pure, he acquires a sweet-smelling
                            body.<br>
              Whoever performs the bathing of the <span class="bibit">Gaṇottama</span>
                            becomes big-eyed and bright, golden-limbed and of pleasing aspect, and
                            sets off (?).<br>
              A gift in this matter is the best, the most excellent
                            of gifts. In the works connected with baths it is an example of action.
                            Let there be honour to the Jinas, the Tathagatas who take delight in the
                            good of beings, and vision of supreme truth.<br>
              Let there also be
                            honour to those who exist in themselves, the pratyekabuddhas who have
                            sought solitude, who take delight alone in the mountain caves, devoted
                            to their own aims, delighted in continence and virtue.<br>
              Also let the
                            disciples, those dear to the Jina who have passed by in this interval of
                            time, be honoured, of whom he from the Koḍ́inya family was first and
                            Subhadra the last.<br>
              Let those (who make) gifts on this point enjoy
                            (the reward even) when the chief king of <span class="bibit">Gaṇas</span>, the Elders,
                            the middle, and younger monks have not arrived, and when they have
                            arrived, let them be perpetually enlightened.<br>
              May the monks who are
                            assembled in this gathering, who bathe in the <span class="bibit">jaṃdāka</span>-baths
                            and honour and love their teachers, be pure in their current duties,
                            with minds free from hatred (or fault).<br>
              In this (matter of) baths
                            let both he who provides material for removing dirt, he who provides oil
                            for rubbing, and he who provides a dry bath, be free from fault and
                            impurity.<br>
              I am devoted to the Vihāra, to the law of the Tathāgata
                            and his excellent virtue; as a result of removing dirt, let their minds
                            be calm, and let them undertake the lawful protection of men.<br>
              All
                            creatures that exist from the bottom of Hell up to the summit of being,
                            on entering the doctrine of the Tathāgatas, make an end of birth and
                            death.<br>
              Let there always be good begging and plenty; let Indra the
                            lord of sacrifice rain increase; let the crops come up and the king (go
                            forth) to victory. May he long abide in the law of the Blessed One.<br>

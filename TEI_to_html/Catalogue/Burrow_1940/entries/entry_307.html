                            much, immeasurable to the great <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka, of pleasant
                            aspect, whose life is a hundred divine years worthy of him, a divinity
                            in person; and I am exceedingly pleased to hear from you that you are in
                            good health. I too am well, you will be pleased to hear, and thus (I
                            write), namely: Just as formerly people belonging to my district have
                            been under your care, so let them now be altogether under your care.
                            Whatever tax (there is) from there, let it be collected. Also what corn
                            had to be bought by (a payment of) wine, so let it be bought. Particular
                            instructions must be given to the <span class="bibit">yatma</span> and
                                <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span>, that nothing must be short and also to the
                                <span class="bibit">yatma</span> and <span class="bibit">aǵeta</span> each of whom have to go in

              Note: The term <span class="bibit">śamuda rayana</span> presents considerable
                            difficulties. It is apparently the same as occurs in 387 (10). There,
                            however, the text reads <span class="bibit">śamuṃta</span> instead of
                                <span class="bibit">śamuḍa</span> here. Further, the passage in 387 runs:
                                <span class="bibit">śamuṃta rayana iṃci vis̱ajidavya</span>. As the particle
                                <span class="bibit">iṃci</span> is only used in the documents to strengthen the
                            negatives <span class="bibit">na</span> and <span class="bibit">ma</span>, it is clear that the
                            syllable <span class="bibit">na</span> in this passage is the negative "not" and has
                            to be connected with the <span class="bibit">iṃci</span> following it, and cannot form
                            part of the preceding word (as it is printed). We must therefore take
                            the word as <span class="bibit">śamuṃta-raya</span> not <span class="bibit">śamuṃta rayana</span>,
                            unless we assume that the scribe has omitted one syllable
                                <span class="bibit">na</span>. If that is so the <span class="bibit">śamuḍa rayana</span> in
                            this passage must be from the context a genitive plural, and the context
                            further suggests that it is some animal that lives on meat. The term
                                <span class="bibit">aṃgha</span> (=<span class="bibit">aṅka</span>) "mark" is quite in
                            conformity with this, since they would be marked if they were animals.
                            With <span class="bibit">śamuṃta</span> we may further compare <span class="bibit">śamuta</span> in
                            15, where the element <span class="bibit">raya</span> is absent. That document deals
                            with hunting (<span class="bibit">nac̄ira</span>) and so would be quite in conformity
                            with the word meaning some animal.<br>
              The term <span class="bibit">aṃbaṃjayaṃmi</span> is completely obscure, as also is
                                <span class="bibit">śuǵa bhava</span> (O. 3).<br>
              <span class="bibit">edes̱a</span> is a mistake for <span class="bibit">edeṣa</span>.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . . The treasurer Kuviñeya reports that two men,
                            fathers, belonging to him escaped and are there. When this sealed
                            wedge-tablet reaches you, forthwith these men are to be carefully
                            searched for. The bridge is to be put into the charge of Cimaka and
                            Sekla, so that they shall not escape to another kingdom. In the year
                            before last there was a wedge-tablet concerning these men (sent) in the
                            hand of Suḡ́i, (but) up till to-day nothing has been heard. Again there
                            was a letter of command in the hand of the secret agent Lýipta and again
                            no decision was heard of. Again there was a letter of instruction with a
                            detailed account concerning these men in the hand of Suḡ́i. Now the
                            matter has been carefully examined here. (We find that) for three years
                            these men have been working there and you do not send them here. If
                            suitable people shall come here, these men are to be sent here in their
                            hands, so that they shall not again disappear from the road.<br>

              The women said that these men are [. . .] and Patruǵa. They are to be
                            carefully inquired after in whatever village and house they are.<br>
              Also Cimaka and Ṣekla have spoken. They said that-they are in Caḍ́ota.
                            One time a letter of command concerning these men was taken in the hand
                            of Suḡ́iya. A second time Lýipta took a letter of command. There was a
                            letter of command in the hand of Kapǵeya. A fourth time the

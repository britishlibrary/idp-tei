              His majesty, etc. . . . Lýipeya reports that their slave Cimikae, without
                            asking their permission, gave her daughter to the slaves of Kapǵe as an
                            adopted child. That adopted child was brought up by them. The payment
                            for milk was not given. When, etc. . . you must investigate whether
                            really their slave gave an adopted child to the slaves of Kapǵe without
                            asking their permission, and the payment for milk has not been given.
                            (If so) a <span class="bibit">tirsa</span> mare or a <span class="bibit">tirṣa</span> horse is to be
                            taken by Lýipeya from the slaves of Kapǵe and the adopted child will
                            belong entirely to them. If, however, there is any dispute, etc. . . .

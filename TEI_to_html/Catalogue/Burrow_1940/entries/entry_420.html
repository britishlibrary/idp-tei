              In the 27th year of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mayiri, the son of

                                <span class="bibit">korara</span> Kaṃjaka owes one <span class="bibit">vyala</span> camel to the
                                <span class="bibit">ari</span> Śarasṕa. At the time the <span class="bibit">ari</span> Śarasṕa
                            was about to die he left an injunction with his sister Śariyae to ask
                            the camel of Kaṃjaka. Now Kaṃjaka arose, and handed over to Śariyae and
                            Śrivaṃma one camel aged four years. For that reason (?) Kaṃjaka took
                            back one <span class="bibit">putǵetsa</span> and six <span class="bibit">arohaǵa muli</span>. There
                            the witnesses are Ariśa, a woman Sevaśrṛyae; on a second occasion the
                            witnesses are the <span class="bibit">kala</span> Cuǵape, Ṣamayaṃna, Larsu, and the
                                <span class="bibit">vasu</span> Kuñita. The thread was cut. From now on Śariya and

              His majesty, etc. . . The <span class="bibit">vasu suveṭha</span> Bhimasena reports
                            that a man called Vusmeka who is a member of the
                            <span class="bibit">kilme</span>(district) of Yav́e av́ana, has moved out to Yav́e
                            av́ana by mother right (because his mother was native there). On his
                            father's side (?) he is of Caḍ́ota. He fled from Caḍ́ota and they have
                            him working there (i. e. in Yav́e av́ana). (Only) people who belong to
                            Yav́e av́ana on their father's side are to be employed in Yav́e av́ana.
                            Because they have been employing this man there, for that reason they
                            pay <span class="bibit">s̱ikhi</span> corn as hire. When this sealed wedge-tablet
                            reaches you, forthwith careful inquiry must be made. Wherever this man
                            Vusmeka has been employed, he is tube handed over to Caṣǵeya along with
                            the hire, along with the monks. Whoever dispute this, are to be sent
                            here.<br>

              His majesty, etc. . . Sunaṃda reports that his grandmother (?) Ramoṃtiae
                            by name adopted a woman called Ramaśri. The people of Salve's household
                            are taking all the sons, daughters, slaves, and dependents of Ramaśriae,
                            and employing them. The arrangement made by the mother was that equal
                            division was to be made of the children and dependants of Ramaśriae. Now
                            (however) these (others) receive nothing. This dispute, etc. . .<br>
            <br>
            
              Note: This same dispute forms the subject also of Nos. 538 and 542.<br>
              
                            The word <span class="bibit">mahuli</span> is here tentatively rendered "grandmother",
                            because Ramotiae is referred to as mother of Suǵnuta (538, 542), while
                            the latter appears as father of Sunaṃda (524). An alternative suggestion
                                (<span class="bibit">L.Kh.D.</span>, index, s.v.), was that it = Skt.
                                <span class="bibit">mātulī</span>, but this would need the existence of two
                            Sunaṃtas.<br>

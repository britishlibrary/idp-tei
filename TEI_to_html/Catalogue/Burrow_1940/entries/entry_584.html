              This document is to be carefully kept by Kutreya and Ramṣotsa.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">guśura</span> Jebhatra, the <span class="bibit">caṃkura</span>
                            Caraǵa and the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka.<br>
              In the 4th year, 2nd month, 28th day of the reign of his majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mahiriya,
                            son of heaven, the <span class="bibit">guśura</span> Jebhatra, the
                                <span class="bibit">caṃkura</span> Cataraǵa, the <span class="bibit">cuv́alayina</span> Dirpara,
                            and the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span> Soṃjaka examined a dispute. Ramṣotsa,
                            Kutreya, and Cinika brought an action concerning sheep. When Kutreya was
                                <span class="bibit">aṣǵa</span>, at that time they took a gift of honour to
                            Ramṣotsa. They gave him four sheep. Vuǵinǵa gave them, Suḡ́uta took
                            them. After that Kutreya, Vuǵinǵa, and Cinika carried off twenty sheep
                            from Ramṣotsa. This case was put off. Vuḡ́inga died. Suḡ́uta is in
                            Khotan. When Suḡ́uta comes back from Khotan, at that time the matter is
                            to betaken in hand. It is to be carefully examined with oath and
                            witness.<br>

              [Manuscript in the National Library of India, New Delhi: not currently available on IDP.]<br>
            <br>
            
              This deed concerning a girl Smitsae is to be carefully kept by the scribe
                            Ramṣotsa.<br>
              In the 11th year of the reign of his majesty the great king
                            Aṃguvaka, son of heaven, in the 2nd month, 12th day, there is a woman
                            called Lýipiṃtsaae and her son called Pǵita. They arose and sold to the
                            scribe Ramṣotsa in time of famine a girl called Smitsae. The price given
                            was one camel one year old valued at forty. Lýipiṃtsae and Pǵita
                            received it. As price of the head (?) four sheep were given. So the
                            scribe Ramṣotsa has ownership over that girl Smitsae, to do what he
                            likes with her. They agreed in front of the magistrates
                                <span class="bibit">kitsaitsa</span> Piteya and <span class="bibit">kāla</span> Karaṃtsa.
                            Witnesses are the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> Caḍhiya, the <span class="bibit">togha</span>
                            Śāṃcā, the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Kuraǵeya, Apǵeya, Capuǵa, Moǵata,
                            Mañǵeya, Lýipta, the monk Dham̄adara, and the <span class="bibit">yatma</span> Cato.
                            This deed was written by me the scribe Moǵata, son of the scribe
                            Tamasṕa, at the command of the magistrates. Its authority is a hundred
                            years, as long as life. The <span class="bibit">toṃgha</span> Śāṃcā cut the string.
                            That girl Smitsae is four <span class="bibit">diṣṭis</span> high. Lýipimtsaae received
                            half of the price, and the <span class="bibit">mas̱ina yatma</span> Ciǵitoya received
                            half.<br>

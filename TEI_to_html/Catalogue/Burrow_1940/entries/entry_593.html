              This document concerning a three years old female camel from Balaseṃna
                            and Kupṣuta is to be well kept by Suḡ́uta.<br>
              This is the seal of the <span class="bibit">cozbos</span> Ṣamas̱ena and Pǵo. In the 17th year of his
                            majesty the great king Jiṭugha Mahiriya, son of heaven, in the 6th month,
                            20th day, in this reign, there is a man of Parvata (called) Kupṣuta. He
                            received a three years old pregnant female camel from Śarsena and gave
                            it to Suḡ́uta. Śarsena arose and took it from Suḡ́uta. Now here Suḡ́uta,
                            Kupṣuta, Śarsena's son Balaseṃna, and his slave Śrustinǵa have brought
                            an action concerning (this) three years old female camel. This dispute
                            was examined by the magistrates the <span class="bibit">cozbos</span> Ṣamas̱ena and
                            Pǵo and the secret agent Opǵeya. A decision was made. Now Kupṣuta,
                            Suḡ́uta, Balaseṃna, and Śrustinǵa have no claim to payment from each
                            other. Witnesses to this are the noble people, the <span class="bibit">cozbo</span>
                            Dham̄ena, Suḡ́i, Kuleya, the <span class="bibit">v́asu</span> V́arpeya, the
                                <span class="bibit">apsu</span> V́̇ua, the <span class="bibit">ṣoṭhaṃgha</span> Kutaǵa, the

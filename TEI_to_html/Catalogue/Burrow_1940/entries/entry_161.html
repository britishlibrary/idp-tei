                            etc. . . . thus (write): One man there, a fugitive, was granted to me by
                            his majesty. Certainly to this (man) Cañaǵa [. . . ] you will do.
                            Quickly what is right must be given him from you. This will be right for
                            me. Also let this Cañaǵa be by all means under your care; whatever his
                            needs are, certainly you must pay attention to them. If you do this
                            thing for me I can do something in return for you there. Whichever of
                            your people comes here in the future I will look upon them as my own. He
                            is to be sent here in the hand of available messengers. We have sent a
                            small present as a token of thoughtfulness, from Kukita one

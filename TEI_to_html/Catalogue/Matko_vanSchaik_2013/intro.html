    <p>This catalogue compiles all of the scribal colophons from the British Library
                manuscripts of the Prajñāpāramitā and Aparimitāyus sūtras
                produced during the Tibetan empire during the 830s and 840s. Transliterations are in
                the Wylie convention, with the addition of capital I for the reverse gi
                gu, and $ for the opening curl.</p> The colophons were transliterated by Marta Matko and edited by Sam van Schaik. We would like to thank the Leverhulme Trust for the funding that make this work possible. We would also like to thank Kazushi Iwao, Lewis Doney and Brandon Dotson for their comments and corrections.

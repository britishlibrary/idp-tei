    <p>This catalogue compiles all of the scribal colophons from the British Library
                manuscripts of the Prajñāpāramitā and Aparimitāyus sūtras
                produced during the Tibetan empire during the 830s and 840s. Transliterations are in
                the Wylie convention, with the addition of capital I for the reverse gi

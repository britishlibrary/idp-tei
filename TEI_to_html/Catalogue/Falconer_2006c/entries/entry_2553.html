              PUBLISHED: 'Innermost Asia', vol. 2, fig. 397: 'Hindukush peaks above Ishmarg, seen across Ab-i-Panja.' View along river towards mountains. '...farther down [the valley] opposite Ishmarg...and at other points in the valley, grand vistas opened to the south. Towering above narrow side valleys, and seemingly quite near, magnificient ice-clad peaks of the Hindukush main range could be seen, looking just like peaks of jade or silver, as Sung-yun and his fellow-pilgrim Hui-sheng describe them, on their passage down the 'kingdom of Po-ho' or Wakhan, A.D. 519.'

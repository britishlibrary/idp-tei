            <span class="bibit">Sher Ali Khan and his companions arrive from Ssu-chuen. [Miran.]</span><br>
            
              Full-length portrait of the three men standing in front of stupa remains at Miran. PUBLISHED: ' Innermost Asia', vol. 1, fig. 121: 'Sher Ali Khan, Bajauri trader, with two travel companions.' Sher Ali Khan's arrival at Miran was fortunate: Stein had just received news from Sir George Macartney that the provincial government at Urumchi had issued an edict ordering all district authorities to prevent his carrying out further survey work, and if necessary to arrest him and escort him back to Kashgar. Although these orders did not get through to the officials in direct contact with Stein and thus did not affect his work, they prevented new camels being sent out to him from Charkhlik. The trader Sher Ali Khan ('this hardy and intelligent Pathan' whom Stein had first met at Dunhuang in 1907) fortunately at this point arrived with a caravan of forty camels on his biennial journey from Ssu-chuan to Yarkand, and agreed to supply Stein with the necessary animals. (i, 176-77). (I.A. Map 30, B2).<br>

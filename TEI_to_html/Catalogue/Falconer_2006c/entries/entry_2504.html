              PUBLISHED: 'Innermost Asia', vol. 2, fig. 356: 'Kokan beg, headman of Kirghiz about Great Kara-kul.' Kokan Beg seated on horse, his son standing in front: 'The necessity of securing fresh transport and a fresh guide for our further move obliged me next day to seek contact with Kokan Beg, the headman of the Kirghiz who graze about the Great Kara-kul lake eastwards...On our descent down the wide gently sloping valley I was met by Kokan Beg, a fine looking man, and conducted by him to a small summer camp of some of his men at Kara-chim at an elevation of some 13,700 feet. From that capable headman I was able to secure useful advice with regard to our future route.' (ii, 852).<br>

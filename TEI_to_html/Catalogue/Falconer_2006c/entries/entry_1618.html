              Close view of rock with carved inscrption and stupa image. '...It was a particularly gratifying find when I discovered an old Tibetan inscription scratched deep into a large boulder on the track where it ascends by the side of a steep moraine flanking the southern glacier of the Darkot. It is very probable that it is a relic of that short-lived Tibetan advance on the uppermost Oxus which the T'ang Annals record towards the close of the second quarter of the eighth century, and which Kao Hsien-chih's adventurous expedition successfully stopped.' ('A third journey...', p. 12). Another view at print 125. PUBLISHED: 'Innermost Asia', vol. 1, fig. 46: 'Engraved boulder with stupa design and Tibetan inscription on ascent to Darkot Pass.'<br>

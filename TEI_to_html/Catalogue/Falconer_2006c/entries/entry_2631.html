              General view of glacier, with horseman in foreground. ' According to the headman's statement the glacier had considerably advanced since his father's youth, and so also had the smaller glacier of Ferokh-sangau...which was passed at an elevation of some 1,700 feet below the snout of Shitok-lazar. It stretches down from WSW into a perfectly level basin, about half a mile long and a quarter across.' (ii, 884).

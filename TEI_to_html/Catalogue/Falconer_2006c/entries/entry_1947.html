            <span class="bibit">L.A. Probable position of east gate and north front of east wall, seen from north-west. [Lou-lan site, Lop Desert.]</span><br>
            
              PUBLISHED: 'Innermost Asia', vol. 1, fig 157: 'North end of eroded terrace bearing foundation of east wall, L.A. station. (See p. 215, note 3.)' This note reads (in part): 'In Fig. 157 the north end of the same [east-north-east] wall segment is seen, with the layer of tamarisk brushwood which has prevented complete erosion. On the right appears a small tamarisk-cone which had grown up later on wind-eroded lower ground. Reference to the measuring rod in the photograph shows that the ground level near by has been lowered by at least a further 5 or 6 feet since the growth of this tamarisk-cone began. In the same fig. is seen in the foreground the debris of heavy timber which may mark the last remains of the gate leading through the east wall (cf. Serindia, i. p. 388).' (I.A. Map 29, D3).<br>

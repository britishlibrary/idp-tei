            <span class="bibit">Vairocana with the eight bodhisattvas.</span><br>
            
              Among the paintings recovered from Dunhuang, the British Museum possesses an example previously identified as Amitābha accompanied by the eight Bodhisattvas. This painting has several inscribed cartouches written in Tibetan, and is believed to have been painted during the Tibetan occupation of Dunhuang. In many respects, the iconography and composition of this representation are virtually identical with the lDan ma brag Vairocana. Beneath a canopy, the gold-color Buddha is crowned, hair in braids, dressed in dhoti and adorned with jewelery, his hands in <span class="bibit">dhyāna mūdra</span>; the eight Bodhisattva surround the Buddha in two rows of four. The costumes of the Dunhuang scroll are inspired by Indian garments. The lotus pedestal and lion throne beneath the central figure are quite similar to the lDan ma brag carving. Two distinguishing factors for Amitābha, the peacock vehicle and the color red, are notably absent from the Dunhuang painting. Although no certain identifications may be made of the eight Bodhisattva surrounding the Buddha of the rock carving, in the light of the iconographic information presented here, the question may be raised whether the two compositions indeed represent a particular treatise then popular, associating the eight Bodhisattva with Vairocana. In addition to the Tibetan representations, Chinese, Central Asian, and Indian examples of this iconography have been identified, all firmly dated (by virtue of excavation) to the eleventh century or earlier.

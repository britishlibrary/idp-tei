      <p>This catalogue brings together the work of Amy Heller on Stein Painting 50, identified as an image of the buddha Vairocana surrounded by the eight bodhisattvas, correcting a previous identification of the central figure as Amitābha. The main text was first published in Kværne, P. (ed.), <span class="bibit">Tibetan Studies: Proceedings of the 6th International Seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies, Fagernes 1992, Oslo (The Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture)</span>, 1994, vol.1, pp.335-49 and Appendix to Volume 1, pp.12-19.

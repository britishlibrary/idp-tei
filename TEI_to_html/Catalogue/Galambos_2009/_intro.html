      <p>This is a translation of the text of the manuscript Or.8210/S.3326. It starts from the first entry which contains continuous text and ends with the authorâ€™s note at the end of this section. The second part is the technical text accompanying the astronomical charts. The parts where the manuscript is worn and illegible are marked in square brackets; I marked such places with missing text dots inside the brackets: [...]. Where the missing text could be reconstructed on the basis of the context, I
 included the translation within the brackets.</p>

      <p>This is an edition by Seishi Karashima of two pages from a printed version of the
                    <span class="bibit">Prajñāpāramitā-hṛdaya-sūtra</span> or 'Heart Sutra'. The
                fragment is from the Tangut city of Kharakhoto. The text contains a Chinese
                transliteration from the original Sanskrit. As Karashima shows, the syllables in the
                Siddham script are not from an original Sanskrit version, but are an attempt to
                reconstruct the Sanskrit based on the Chinese characters.</p>
      <p>Andrew West has shown that the Chinese text is almost identical to the text carved on
                one of the 10,082 stone tablets engraved during the reign of Emperor Daozong of Liao
                that were found in 1957 and 1958 in the Pagoda of Yunju Temple (雲居寺) in Fangshan
                District, Beijing. The text corresponds to lines 42-47 (left page) and 47-49 (right
                page) of the transcription <a href="http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=F27n1056_001" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

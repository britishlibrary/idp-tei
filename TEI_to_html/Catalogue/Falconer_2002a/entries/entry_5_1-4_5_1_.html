              Stein Photo 5/1-4: 1st Central Asian Expedition, 1900-1901<br>
              Three albums, uniformly bound in red half-leather measuring 34.5x35 cm, with half-plate printing-out paper prints mounted two to a page in aperture mounts with openings 10x15.2 cm., plus 14 loose duplicates extracted from albums. The photographs are almost all uncaptioned, apart from occasional pencilled notes on the mounts, but are referenced with Stein's negative number in pencil and almost all are dated on the reverse. The prints are generally in excellent condition. Titles for this collection have been extracted either from copies of the images published in Sand-buried Ruins of Khotan (cited as SRK) and Ancient Khotan (AK), or from the captioned duplicates of many of the prints which can be found at Stein Photo 8. The location of duplicate copies in Stein Photo 8 are noted in square brackets before the negative reference number. The subject matter of the three albums can be broken down as follows:<br>

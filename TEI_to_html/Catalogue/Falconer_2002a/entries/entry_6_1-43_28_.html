              Stein Photo 6: 1st Central Asian Expedition, 1900-1901<br>
              Red half-leather album, partially filled with 67 uncaptioned quarter-plate printing-out paper prints; the album is similar in design to those in Stein Photo 5/1-3, but in landscape format, with prints mounted two to a page in aperture mounts. The album can be divided by subject matter into two groups:<br>
              Photo-theodolite views<br>
              Photo-theodolite views of mountain scenery, uncaptioned, but dated and numbered in the negative. The views taken on each day can be linked to form panoramic views of varying completeness, each succeeding print representing an approximately 30 degree increment from the previous photograph (prints 22-33, for instance, form the most complete group in the series, a 360 degree panorama in 12 sections, taken on 4 Nov 1900). Approximate locations for these views can be extrapolated from Stein's account of his journey in Sand-buried Ruins of Khotan.<br>

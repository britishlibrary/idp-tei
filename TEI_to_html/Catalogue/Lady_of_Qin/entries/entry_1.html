                            Weizhuang.</span><br>
            
              <p>
                In the guimao year of Zhonghe, in the third month of spring,<br>
                Outside the city walls of Luoyang, the blossom was like snow.<br>
                East and west, north and south, wayfarers were at rest;<br>
                The green willows were still, their fragrant scent was
                                    departed.<br>
                Suddenly, by the wayside I saw a flower-like lady<br>
                Reclining in solitude beneath the shade of the green willows.<br>
                Her phoenix head-dress was awry, and a lock of hair lay athwart
                                    her temples.<br>
                Her face showed traces of care, and there was a pucker between
                                    her eyebrows.<br>
                I made bold to question her, saying: "O Lady, whence do you
                                    come?"<br>
                Looking distressed, she was about to speak, when a sob choked her
                                    utterance.<br>
                Then, turning her head and gathering up her sleeves, she
                                    apologized to the traveller:<br>
                "Tossed and engulfed in the waves of revolution, how can I find
                                    words to speak?<br>
                Three years back I fell into the hands of the rebels and was
                                    detained in the land of Qin,<br>
                And the things that happened in Qin seem engraved in my
                                    memory.<br>
                If you, Sir, can loosen your golden saddle to hear my story,<br>
                I for my part will stay my jade footsteps in your company....<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                The year before last, on the fifth day of the sacrificial moon in
                                    Gengzi,<br>
                I had just shut the golden bird-cage after giving a lesson to my
                                    parrot<br>
                And was looking sidelong in my phoenix mirror as I lazily combed
                                    my hair,<br>
                Idly leaning the while on the carved balustrade in silent
                                    thought,<br>
                When suddenly I beheld a cloud of red dust rising outside the
                                    gates,<br>
                And men appeared in the streets beating metal drums.<br>
                The citizens rush out of doors half-dazed with terror,<br>
                And the courtiers come flocking in, still suspecting a false
                                    rumour.<br>
                Meanwhile, Government troops are entering the city from the
                                    west,<br>
                And propose to meet the emergency by marching to the Tong
                                    Pass.<br>
                The general cry is that the Boye troops are holding the enemy in
                                    check,<br>
                And all agree that the rebel army, though on the way, has not yet
                                    arrived.<br>
                Yet a little while, and my husband gallops up on horseback;<br>
                Dismounting, he enters the gate; stupefied he stands, like a
                                    drunken man.<br>
                Even now he had met the Purple Canopy departing into exile,<br>
                And had seen the white banners advancing from all parts of the
                                    country....<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Supporting the infirm and leading children by the hand, fugitives
                                    are calling to one another in the turmoil;<br>
                Some clamber on to roofs, others scale walls, and all is in
                                    disorder.<br>
                Neighbours in the south run into hiding with neighbours in the
                                    north,<br>
                And those in the east make for shelter with those in the
                                    west.<br>
                Our northern neighbour's womenfolk, trooping all together,<br>
                Dash wildly about in the open like stampeding cattle.<br>
                Boom, boom! — Heaven and earth shake with the rumbling of chariot
                                    wheels,<br>
                And the thunder of ten thousand horses' hoofs re-echoes from the
                                    ground.<br>
                Fires burst out, sending golden sparks high up into the
                                    firmament,<br>
                And the twelve official thoroughfares are soon seething with
                                    smoke and flame.<br>
                The sun's orb sinks in the west, giving place to the cold pale
                                    light of the moon.<br>
                God utters never a word, but His heart is surely bursting within
                                    him.<br>
                A dark halo of misty cloud seems to encircle the moon with many
                                    rings,<br>
                And the Eunuch Stars, gliding in their courses, assume the colour
                                    of blood;<br>
                The Purple Exhalation secretly follows the Emperor's Throne as it
                                    shifts from place to place,<br>
                And baleful rays are stealthily shooting at the Tai Stars for
                                    their destruction.<br>
                Every home now runs with bubbling fountains of blood,<br>
                Every place rings with a victim's shrieks — shrieks that cause
                                    the very earth to quake.<br>
                Dancers and singing-girls must all undergo secret outrage;<br>
                Infants and tender maidens are torn living from their parents'
                                    arms.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Our eastern neighbour had a daughter, whose eyebrows were but
                                    newly painted:<br>
                A beauty above all price, to overthrow a city or a state;<br>
                Between tall spears she is escorted into a warrior's chariot,<br>
                Turning to gaze back at her fragrant boudoir, while her
                                    handkerchief is soaked with tears.<br>
                So now she is pulling out golden thread and learning to sew
                                    banners,<br>
                Or she is raised upon a carved saddle and made to sit a galloping
                                    steed.<br>
                Now and again, from her horse, she catches sight of her
                                    goodman,<br>
                But dares not turn her eyes upon him, and has to shed tears in
                                    vain.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Our western neighbour had a daughter — verily, a fairy
                                    maiden!<br>
                Sidelong glances flashed from her large limpid eyes,<br>
                And when her toilet was done, she reflected the spring in her
                                    mirror;<br>
                Young in years, she knew naught of the world outside her
                                    door.<br>
                A ruffian comes leaping up the steps of her abode;<br>
                Pulling her robe from one bare shoulder, he attempts to do her
                                    violence,<br>
                But, though dragged by her clothes, she refuses to pass out of
                                    the vermilion portal,<br>
                And thus with her rouge and fragrant unguents she meets her death
                                    under the knife.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Our southern neighbour had a daughter — I cannot recall her
                                    name;<br>
                'Twas but the other day that a worthy go-between had brought her
                                    betrothal present<br>
                She had heard no footfalls on her steps of glazed tiles,<br>
                And saw but the shadows of men on her blind of kingfisher
                                    blue.<br>
                Suddenly the clash of sword-blades is heard in the courtyard
                                    below,<br>
                And in a moment's space heads and trunks are lying severed on the
                                    ground.<br>
                Raising their eyes to heaven, then covering their faces, and
                                    uttering one wail of horror,<br>
                She and her sister threw themselves together into a well.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                At our northern neighbour's, the youthful matron was being urged
                                    to depart;<br>
                So she was shaking out her cloud-like tresses, and wiping the
                                    paint from her eyebrows,<br>
                When she heard the noise of men battering down the lofty
                                    gates,<br>
                And instinctively she climbed the stairs into the upper
                                    storey.<br>
                But soon on every side there appeared the blaze of fire,<br>
                And when she would have descended again, the staircase itself was
                                    destroyed.<br>
                Then came loud screams from amidst the smoke, still imploring for
                                    rescue,<br>
                But ere long her corpse, hanging over the cross-beams, was
                                    reduced to ashes.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                By good hap, I was able to preserve myself intact from murderous
                                    weapons;<br>
                But daring not stand irresolute nor look back at the home I was
                                    leaving, I combed the hair over my brows to follow the army on
                                    their march,<br>
                And, forcing a cheerful expression,33) issued forth from the door
                                    of my dwelling.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                No means, after this, of returning to my old village;<br>
                No place, henceforth, where I could seek my kith and kin;<br>
                For since I fell into the rebels' hands three years have run
                                    their course,<br>
                And always I have been a prey to anxious care, my heart quaking
                                    with fear.<br>
                At night I lie encircled by a thousandfold ring of swords and
                                    spears,<br>
                In the morning I have to make a meal off minced human livers.<br>
                Albeit I am taken to a nuptial couch, how can it give me joy?<br>
                Though I have jewels and riches in plenty, they are not my
                                    heart's desire.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Their hair is unkempt, their faces begrimed, their eyebrows
                                    shaggy and red:<br>
                Often when I turn my eyes upon them, I cannot endure the
                                    sight.<br>
                Their clothes are put on all awry, the language they speak is
                                    strange;<br>
                Overweening pride in their prowess is writ large in their
                                    faces.<br>
                Their officers of the Cypress Terrace are a lot of cunning
                                    foxes,<br>
                Their members of the Orchid Office are so many slinking rats.<br>
                In their close-cropped hair they would fain stick ornamental
                                    hairpins,<br>
                Without removing their Court robes they roll themselves in
                                    embroidered coverlets.<br>
                Clutching their ivory tablets upside down, they masquerade as
                                    Ministers of State;<br>
                With the golden fish at their girdles wrong way up, they play the
                                    part of Court officials.<br>
                In the morning I hear them entering the Audience Chamber to
                                    present their memorials,<br>
                But in the evening one sees them brawling as they make their way
                                    to the wine tavern.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                One morning, in the fifth watch, everybody gets up in alarm,<br>
                With much shouting and excited clamour, as though discussing some
                                    secret news.<br>
                During the night, it seems, a mounted scout had ridden into the
                                    Imperial City<br>
                To say that the previous day the Government troops had occupied
                                    Chishui.<br>
                Now, Chishui is but a hundred li from the city,<br>
                And if they set out at dawn they ought to be here by
                                    nightfall.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                The ruffianly crew sit in gloomy silence on their horses,<br>
                But the female attendants in my chamber give secret vent to their
                                    joy.<br>
                All say that our grievous wrongs will now be avenged,<br>
                And we confidently expect that the villainous horde will this day
                                    meet their doom.<br>
                Horsemen galloping hither and thither fill the air with exciting
                                    rumours:<br>
                'Tis said that our army is on the march to enter the capital in
                                    full strength!<br>
                Big Peng and little Peng look at each other in distress,<br>
                While What's-his-name and What-d'ye-call-him cling to their
                                    saddles and weep.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus things drift on for several days, and still there is no
                                    news,<br>
                So we must suppose that these advancing troops already have jade
                                    tablets in their mouths,<br>
                And that they came waving flags and brandishing swords only in
                                    order to submit;<br>
                Further it is reported that all the Government armies have been
                                    routed and put to flight.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                After this, great misery and distress prevail on every side;<br>
                A bushel of gold is the price of a single peck of grain;<br>
                In Shang Rang's kitchen the bark of trees is used as food,<br>
                On Huang Chao's table human flesh is carved.<br>
                Communication is cut off from the south-east, and there is no
                                    road for supplies.<br>
                Gradually the ditches and streams are choked up, while the
                                    population dwindles.<br>
                Stiffening corpses lie in heaps outside the Liujun Gate,<br>
                And the Qijia Camp is strewn with those who have starved to
                                    death.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Chang'an lies in mournful stillness: what does it now
                                    contain?<br>
                — Ruined markets and desolate streets, in which ears of wheat are
                                    sprouting.<br>
                Fuel-gatherers have hacked down every flowering plant in the
                                    Apricot Gardens,<br>
                Builders of barricades have destroyed the willows along the
                                    Imperial Canal.<br>
                All the gaily-coloured chariots with their ornamented wheels are
                                    scattered and gone,<br>
                Of the stately mansions with their vermilion gates less than half
                                    remain.<br>
                The Hanyuan Hall is the haunt of foxes and hares,<br>
                The approach to the Flower-calyx Belvedere is a mass of brambles
                                    and thorns.<br>
                All the pomp and magnificence of the olden days are buried and
                                    passed away;<br>
                Only a dreary waste meets the eye: the old familiar objects are
                                    no more.<br>
                The Inner Treasury is burnt down, its tapestries and embroideries
                                    a heap of ashes;<br>
                All along the Street of Heaven one treads on the bones of State
                                    officials.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Day was breaking when we arrived at the highway east of the
                                    city,<br>
                And outside the walls wind-borne smoke tinged the landscape with
                                    the dismal hue of the frontier region.<br>
                Along the road we sometimes saw roving bands of soldiers;<br>
                At the foot of the Slope was heavy silence — no speeding nor
                                    welcoming of guests.<br>
                Looking eastward from Baling, we see no trace of human life, or
                                    habitation;<br>
                From Li Shan bosomed in trees, the wealth of blue and gold has
                                    utterly departed.<br>
                All the great roads are now become thickets of brambles,<br>
                And benighted travellers sleep in ruined shells, under the light
                                    of the moon.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Next morning, at dawn, we arrive at Sanfenglu,<br>
                Where of countless inhabitants not a single household
                                    remains;<br>
                The deserted fields and gardens show nothing but weeds;<br>
                The trees and bamboos are destroyed, and everything is
                                    ownerless....<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                I turn to interrogate a Golden God in his wayside shrine,<br>
                But the Golden God is silent: he is more melancholy than
                                    ourselves.<br>
                Of the aged cypresses before the temple only mangled stumps
                                    remain;<br>
                The bronze incense-burners in the sanctuary secrete nothing but
                                    dust.<br>
                Ever since the frenzied Eobber brought the Middle Kingdom under
                                    his yoke,<br>
                Heaven and earth have been shrouded in gloom and darkened with
                                    storms;<br>
                The holy water before the altar has failed in its magic
                                    power,<br>
                The warriors of the underworld, painted on the wall, have been
                                    unable to repel the invaders.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                In days of ease (says the God) I was merely content to enjoy the
                                    food-offerings bounteously provided,<br>
                But in time of stress I can bring no aid, nor manifest my
                                    supernatural power.<br>
                Now I am ashamed of being such a helpless God:<br>
                Let me flee far into the mountains and there hide me as best I
                                    can.<br>
                Within these precincts I hear no sound of flutes and pipes,<br>
                In the place of offering I look in vain for a sacrificial
                                    victim.<br>
                Therefore let some hideous demon be installed in my place near
                                    the village,<br>
                Who shall torture and slay the unhappy people from morning to
                                    night.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                — When I heard these words, my melancholy grew deeper still.<br>
                Heaven sends down calamities in their season which are not in our
                                    power to control.<br>
                If a God can flee thus from trouble into the mountains,<br>
                Why should we look with censure on the noblemen in the East?<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                The year before last, I was also taken over the Yangzhen
                                    Pass,<br>
                And, raising my head, saw Mount Jing towering into the
                                    clouds.<br>
                It was like passing out of hell into the company of living
                                    men<br>
                To be suddenly ware of a world untroubled and at peace.<br>
                The Governor of Shanzhou is loyal and upright:<br>
                He excites no clash of arms, but contents himself with guarding
                                    his city.<br>
                The Governor of Pujin is able to repress the spirit of war,<br>
                And all is tranquil for a thousand li: no sound of weapons is
                                    heard.<br>
                By day you may carry your valuables abroad, and no man will
                                    interfere with you;<br>
                By night you may travel all alone, with gold hairpins sticking in
                                    your coiffure.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Next morning, as we passed eastwards of Xin'an,<br>
                We fell in with an old man begging for rice-gruel by the
                                    wayside,<br>
                His hair sprinkled with white, his face of a livid hue,<br>
                Who was crouching for concealment amidst the undergrowth of
                                    weeds.<br>
                I asked him, saying: "To what village do you belong?<br>
                And why are you lying under the cold sky, exposed to frost and
                                    dew?"<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                The old man stood up for a moment and was about to tell his
                                    story,<br>
                But sank back with his head in his hands and wailed aloud to
                                    heaven.<br>
                — "My native homestead was on the register of Dongji Xian,<br>
                And every year I had land covered with crops and mulberry trees
                                    amounting to nearly a tian;<br>
                The fertile fields which I sowed each year were two hundred chan,
                                    in extent;<br>
                The household tax I paid annually came to thirty million
                                    cash.<br>
                My daughters were practised in weaving cloaks of serge and
                                    sarcenet,<br>
                My daughters-in-law were able to cook meals of red millet.<br>
                A thousand granaries were mine!<br>
                Ten thousand waggons too!<br>
                And after Huang Chao's passage, a moiety still was left.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                But ever since the armed hosts have been encamped in Luoxia,<br>
                Day and night, patrolling bands have entered the village
                                    ramparts;<br>
                The glittering blade, like unto the Green Serpent, is plucked
                                    from its scabbard;<br>
                The wind above our heads blows out the flags and reveals the
                                    White Tiger.<br>
                Entering the gates, they dismount and swoop down like a
                                    whirlwind,<br>
                Ransack the buildings, empty the money-bags: everything is swept
                                    bare.<br>
                And when all my patrimony is gone, even my flesh and blood are
                                    torn from me,<br>
                So that now, in my declining years, I am left alone in my
                                    wretchedness.<br>
                Alone in my wretchedness, ah me! yet what call have I to
                                    lament?<br>
                — In the hills there are thousands on thousands like myself,<br>
                Who spend their days searching for wild berries to still their
                                    hunger,<br>
                And sleep by night under the frosty sky, couching upon the rank
                                    weeds".<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                On hearing this old fellow's heart-rending tale of woe,<br>
                Tears coursed down my cheeks all day like rain.<br>
                Stirring abroad, I heard but the hooting of the owl, that bird of
                                    revolution.<br>
                We intended to hasten still further east, to find some place of
                                    abode,<br>
                But now we hear that all traffic by boat or cart is stopped on
                                    the road to Pien.<br>
                They also say that there has been mutual slaughter at
                                    Peng-men,<br>
                Where the aspect of the countryside would cause even a warrior to
                                    swoon,<br>
                And where the rivers and streams are half composed of the blood
                                    of murdered men....<br>
              </p>
              <p>Now I happen to hear that a visitor has arrived from
                                    Jinling,<br>Who reports that in Jiangnan things are quite
                                    otherwise than here;<br>For ever since the Great Brigand
                                    invaded the Central Plain,<br>No war-horses have been bred on
                                    the frontiers of that land.<br>The Governor there regards the
                                    extirpation of thieves and robbers as a work of heavenly
                                    merit,<br>While he treats his people as tenderly as though
                                    they were newborn babes.<br>His walls and moats offer secure
                                    protection, as if made of metal and filled with boiling
                                    water,<br>And with the levies and taxes that pour in like
                                    rain he provides troops and ramparts.<br>While the whole
                                    Empire, alas! is in a state of fermeut,<br>This one district
                                    remains smoothly tranquil and undisturbed;<br>It is only the
                                    denizens of the capital that must flee to escape calamity,<br>So
                                that in our yearning for peace we must envy even the ghosts of
                                Jiangnan.</p>
              — I pray, Sir, that when you have plied the oar once more and
                                journeyed back to the East, You will present to His Excellency this
                                lengthy ballad that I have sung.<br>

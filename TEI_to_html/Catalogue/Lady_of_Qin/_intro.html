      <p>This is a translation by Lionel Giles of a poem about the Huang Chao rebellion. In
                an introduction to the translation (pp.305-325), Giles describes how he collated the
                text from fragments in London and Paris, and sketches the historical background of
                Huang Chao's rebellion. He concludes with the following remarks about the
                translation, "The diction, as befits narrative, is simpler and more direct than in
                the standard poem, and is for the most part free from the allusiveness which is apt
                to make Chinese poetry so obscure. The law of parallelism, too, is not so strictly
                observed, though it is seldom ignored altogether. While trying to make my
                translation readable, I have aimed above all at literalness, so far as this is
                compatible with the fundamental differences of Chinese and English.The poem is a
                long one of its kind - almost exactly twice the length of 'The Everlasting
                Resentment' - and may be conveniently divided into some dozen or more episodes, as
                shown in the following synoptical analysis:</p>
      <p>1-16. Introductory: the poet's
                meeting with the Lady.</p>
      <p>17-32. The Lady's story: the coming of the
                rebels.</p>
      <p>33-52. The sack of Chang'an.</p>
      <p>53-84. The fate of the four
                girls.</p>
      <p>85-108. The Lady in the rebel's camp.</p>
      <p>109-126. A forlorn
                hope.</p>
      <p>127-146. Desolation of the city after the storm.</p>
      <p>147-158. The
                journey through the ruined countryside.</p>
      <p>159-178. Episode of the Golden
                God.</p>
      <p>179-188. On the road to Luoyang.</p>
      <p>189-216. Episode of the old man
                reduced to beggary.</p>
      <p>217-224. Reports from other provinces.</p>
      <p>225-236. A
                visitor from Jiangnan.</p>
      <p>237-238. Envoi.</p>

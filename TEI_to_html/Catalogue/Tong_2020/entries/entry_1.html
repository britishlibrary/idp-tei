如是我聞：一時，薄伽梵在王舍大城竹林園中，與大苾芻眾五百人俱。
時，有眾多苾芻身患痔病，形體羸瘦、痛苦縈纏，於日夜中，極受憂惱。時，具壽阿難陀見是事已，詣世尊所，頂札雙足，在一面立，白言：「世尊！王舍城多有苾芻身患痔病，形體羸瘦、痛苦縈纏，於日夜中，極受憂惱。世尊！此諸病苦，云何救療？」
佛告阿難陀：「汝聽此《療痔病經》，讀誦受持、繫心勿忘，亦於他人，廣為宣說，此諸痔病，悉得除𣧠。所謂：風痔、熱痔、癊痔、三合痔、血痔、腹中痔、鼻內痔、齒痔、舌痔、耳痔、頂痔、手足痔、脊背痔、屎痔……遍身支節所生諸痔，如是痔瘻，悉皆乾燥、墮落、消滅，必差無疑。皆應誦持如是神呪。」
即說呪曰：
「怛姪他　頞闌帝　頞藍謎　室利鞞　室里室里　磨羯失質　三婆跋覩　莎呵」
「阿難陀！於此北方，有大雪山王。中有娑羅樹，名曰『難勝』。有三種花：一者初生、二者圓滿、三者乾枯。猶如彼花，乾燥落時，我諸痔病亦復如是，勿復血出，亦勿膿流，永除苦痛，悉皆平復，即令乾燥。又復若常誦此經者，得宿命智，能憶過去七生之事。呪法成就，莎呵。」
又說呪曰：
「怛姪（他）　苫謎苫謎　捨苫謎　苫末泥去　捨苫泥　莎呵」
佛說是經已，時，具壽阿難陀及諸大眾，皆大歡喜，信受奉持。
佛說痔病經<br>
            <span class="notheader">translation:</span><br> (R1.1-23) The Buddha Speaks of Cancer Sutra, translated by the Tripiṭaka Master Yijing under the royal order.
Thus have I heard at one time when the Buddha was accompanied by the community of five hundred respectable monks in the Bamboo Grove Park of Rajgir…
At that time, many monks were ill with cancers, suffering from severe weight loss and inexorable pains. For days and nights, they had been agonizing. At that time, Brother Ānanda noticed the situation, and he sought the Buddha’s advice. After prostrating before the Buddha’s feet, he stood beside the Buddha, and he reported that “The World-honored One! Many monks in Rajgir are ill with cancers, suffering from severe weight loss and inexorable pains. For days and nights, they have been agonizing. The World-honored One! How can these sicknesses be cured?”
The Buddha told Ānanda that “Listen to this Healing Cancer Sutra. This is what you should read, accept, memorize, share, and spread widely. All these cancers will be exterminated—the so-called vata-dosha cancers, pitta-dosha cancers, kapha-dosha cancers, three-dosha cancers, blood cancers, stomach cancers, nose cancers, gum cancers, tongue cancers, ear cancers, head cancers, limb cancers, spinal cancers, anal cancers, as well as other cancers and tumors throughout body parts, will dry up, fall off, fade away, and then become healed without a doubt. You should chant this miraculous spell.”
Proclaim the mantra which says:
tadyathā alante alame śrive śṝ śṝ makaści saṃbhavatu svāhā
“Ānanda! North from here is a great snowy mountain. There is a species of sal trees, namely sudurjayā, which has three kinds of flowers: the newborn; the mature; and the withered. Similar to those flowers that are withering and falling off, the cancers affecting our monks will no longer bleed or fester. Their pains will be eliminated forever. All of them will restore to health. Command the cancers to dry up now! Again, those who often chant this sutra will obtain the Pubbe-nivāsanussati knowledge to recall their own seven past lives. Achieve the spell, well said.”
Furthermore, proclaim the mantra which says:
tadya(thā) śame śame śaśame śamāne śaśamne svāhā
The Buddha had ended speaking. At that time, Brother Ānanda and the monastic community were delighted. They accepted and practiced the teaching faithfully.

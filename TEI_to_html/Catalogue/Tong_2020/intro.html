      <p>An Ancient Treatment of Cancer in Buddhism Appreciated by Patients across Cultures and Years—The Arsaprasamanasutra is a Buddhist sutra, as well as a spell being exercised to cure hemorrhoid, ulcer, swelling, neoplasm, tumor, and cancer. This book aims to find out whether the Buddha has ever taught a spell for healing cancer, what kind of cancer can be restored to health with the spell, and how the spell may assist today’s cancer patients. Therefore, in order to answer these questions, the Arsaprasamanasutra is critically assessed from its story, scripture, spell, ritual, and contemporary legend. For the first time ever, the Arsaprasamanasutra’s original Sanskrit mantras and ritual details are also reconstructed in a methodical way.</p>
      <p>Ki Wa Tong advocates that the Chinese character “痔” in the title of this sutra does not merely represent hemorrhoid but also ulcer, swelling, neoplasm, tumor, and cancer.</p>

      <p>Victor Mair's catalogue describing five-hundred and ninety-nine Dunhuang manuscripts and highlighting the importance of these early Chinese narrative texts in relation to oral performance. Taken from <span class="bibit">Chinoperl Papers</span>, No. 10 (1981), pp. 5–96.</p>
      <p>Abbreviations used in this inventory: PK (Peking ms #, see appendix two), S (Stein ms #), P (Pelliot ms #), F (Flug ms #), D (Dun’-khuanskogo Fonda ms #), T (<span class="bibit">Tun-huang pien-wen chi</span>), r˚ (recto), v˚ (verso). <span class="smaller">[note: R° is determined by which side of the ms was originally used for writing, v° by the side subsequently used. In the inventory, that side appears first which is more pertinent to the present subject of research.]</span>  ms[s] (manuscript[s]).<br/>
                Symbols: → “emend to”;  {x}  “x is Mair's reconstruction/the translation of Mair's reconstruction”; ? “I am not certain”; = “is a variant orthography for”; [ ] “understood” or “needs to be inserted”; // “end of line”.<br/>
                Caution: Many of the translations in this inventory are highly tentative and are intended merely to serve as the basis for further discussion and research by specialists.</p>
      <p>This catalogue is divided into the following sections:<br/>
				(i) Paris (1–235)<br/>
				(ii) London (236–437)<br/>
				(iii) St Petersburg (437–551) N.B.: Except where noted, the Tun-huang mss in Leningrad consist of fragments that have not been fully identified with regard to subject matter, form, and genre.<br/>
				(iv) China (552–597) N.B.: Items 594–597 are dispersed mss in China. Information taken from pp. 314–356 of Tun-huang i-shu tsung-mu so-yin. Since none of these mss is available for examination, I have been unable to verify any of the information given here.<br/>
				(v) Taiwan (598 only)<br/>
				(vi) Addendum (599 only)</p>
      <p>NOTE ON THE ONLINE EDITION: Many of the hand-drawn variant characters included in Mair's catalogue could not be represented here. They are thus represented by the placeholder [#nnn]. Please refer to original catalogue for these characters, scans of which will soon be made available on IDP.</p>

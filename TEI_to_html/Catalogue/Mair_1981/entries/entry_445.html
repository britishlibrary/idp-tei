              Prosimetric homily in simple classical on the ten auspicious signs 十吉祥 which appeared when Mañjuśrī was born. Perhaps may be entitled 妙吉祥 (the Chinese translation of “Mañjuśrī”) — see 11. 1–3, 90, and 94 of ms. Genre not known. Simple structure in which each auspicious sign is explained first in a few sentences of prose and then elaborated upon in verse. Lacks <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span> and <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span> identifying formulas. Thin, white paper; irregularly ruled. Mediocre hand; notes and additions; corrections and erasures in first portion.

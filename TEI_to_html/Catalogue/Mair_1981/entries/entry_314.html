Used to make the first part of the composite text on T764–769 (ends at 767.2). Lacks identifying <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span> pre-verse formula except once in the concluding portion which is on <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Pelliot chinois 3051</a>; should be classed as a mixed <span class="bibit">nidāna</span>. Begins (764.2–765.5) with the same seat-settling text as that (344.3–345.7) which precedes the prosimetric narrative of the destruction of demons later on this same scroll. An important distinction, however, is that it lacks the identifying <span class="bibit">ya-tso-wen</span> formula of the latter. In its place, it has a short prose bridge leading from the introduction (seat-settling text minus sūtra title quotation formula) to the <span class="bibit">nidāna</span> proper. The prosimetric narrative of the destruction of demons (lacks titles at head and end) follows immediately after the first piece on v° is abandoned. Used in collation of T344.3(年)–345.5, 345.7, 346.9–354.10. After this point, the present ms — which continues with an extract from a sūtra about an Indian king — is completely different from <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Pelliot chinois 2187</a> which addressed itself to topical matters. The parts of the various speakers are marked almost as though this were a playscript. All texts on v° have the same distinctive angular style of calligraphy as r° although it varies from quite small to rather large. Few corrections, additions, and erasures throughout.

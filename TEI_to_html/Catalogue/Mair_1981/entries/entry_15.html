              Letter of salutation from the head of a Buddhist monastery (on separate sheet of paper attached to front of pre-existent scroll). Sūtra lecture text on the <span class="bibit">Vimalakīrti-sūtra</span> (lacks title). T592–618. Good, light drab paper. Mediocre hand; few additions, corrections; red and black highlighting. Colophon (same hand): “On the ninth day of the eight month in 947 at the Zen Temple of Serene Truth in western Szechwan, I finished writing out this copy of the twentieth scroll just as it became dark.	I don’t know how I can get back to my village.” 廣政十年八月九日在西川靜真禪院寫此第廿卷文書恰遇[#8](=抵)黑書了	不知如何得到鄉地去. Second colophon (in a larger, cruder hand; if by the same hand as the first colophon [several key characters do match 於, 年, etc.], it was certainly written at a different time): “I am now forty-eight years old and am holding a lecture at the Yingming Temple in the prefecture. It is exceedingly hot.” 年至四十八歲於州中[#9](=應, well within the range of Tun-huang orthographical variants for this character, even as attested elsewhere in this very ms)明寺開講極是溫熱.

              Sūtra lecture text on the <span class="bibit">Sūtra of the Kindness of Parents</span> 父母恩重經. T695–700. Damaged at beginning and end. Lightly ruled, poor quality beige paper. Mediocre to fairly good hand, large characters; red highlighting, punctuation; corrections. Musical notation (吟) before verse. Hexa- and heptasyllabic verse differentiated by format. Large format, seems at one time to have been folded along the middle since it is split there. Has identifying formula for <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span>.

              Buddhist mantras, hymns, eulogies, and other miscellaneous texts; most with corrections and highlighting. Unruled; fairly good hand.

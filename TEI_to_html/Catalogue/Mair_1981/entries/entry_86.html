              r° and v°	“<span class="bibit">Various Difficult Characters</span>” 諸雜難字壹本 (head title). A very neat (except around margins) copybook.

End colophon: “Inscription of an abbreviated booklet of miscellaneous difficult characters on the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month in the year 990.” 庚寅年五月廿五日略雜難字壹[#22]記.

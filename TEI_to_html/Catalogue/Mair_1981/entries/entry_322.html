              Several non-canonical Buddhist texts. Then “<span class="bibit">Seat-Settling Text of the Great Master, Recorder of Monks on the Street to the Right Side</span>” 右街僧錄大師[#140](=壓)座文 (actual title). Verse, mostly heptasyllabic. T840–841. N.B.: The placement of the title in T is incorrect. It should come <span class="bibit">after</span> the two lines of prose about the building of stūpas throughout the empire which are unrelated to this text other than that they have been written on the same scroll. Lacks identifying <span class="bibit">ya-tso-wen</span> formula. Followed immediately (but separated by a heavy, crudely drawn line which stands out clearly as the addition of a later reader and probably indicates that the text is incomplete) by “<span class="bibit">Seat-Settling Text</span>” 押座文 (actual title). “Recited by ‘Cumulous Debater,’ Recipient of the Purple and Great Master of the Round Mirror Who Is Recorder of Monks on the Street to the Right Side” 右街僧錄圓鑒大師賜䒺(=紫)雲辯述. T835–838. Lacks identifying <span class="bibit">ya-tso-wen</span> formula. There is evidence, however, that this was added in performance for, near the very end of r°, we do find it, followed by “Imperially Conferred Cumulous Debater [the author of the two seat-settling texts]. Lecture in the third month by a <span class="bibit">bhikṣuṇi</span> (?) of the Temple of the Lofty Hall (?) for the repair (?) of this temple.” 宣賜	雲辯	[#141]夏(→崇廈?)寺<span class="bibit">尼</span>三月講為[#142](→修?)本寺. V° is in a mediocre, but uniform, hand; few corrections.

              Official reports concerning firewood. Whitish paper; good hand.

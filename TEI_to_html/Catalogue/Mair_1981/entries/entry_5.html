Furthermore, a disciple at that monastery, the monk Chih-hui, wrote down the first part of the commentary as he listened along. It was not until the twenty-second day of the second month that he finished writing it.” 壬辰年正月一日河西管內都僧政京城進論朝天賜紫大德曹和尚就開元寺為城堭禳灾[#5](sic; superfluous) 講<span class="bibit">維摩經</span>當寺弟子僧智惠並隨聽寫此上批至二月二十二日寫訖.

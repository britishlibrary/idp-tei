              Transformation text on Maudgalyāyana. T741.6–744.4.24. Unruled, beige paper of ordinary quality. Rather hurried, mediocre hand; corrections in red and black. May be part of same ms as <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">BD04085</a>. Ms split in middle and much worn at edges; definitely read repeatedly over a long period of time. Held together on back with eight patches of four different quality papers; beginning portion of scroll (most susceptible to wear) has been patched with good yellow paper. In places, there are patches upon patches, making the ms three layers thick. On v° of a patch near end, the words “newly compatible (?) filial piety” 新合孝. Using a mirror, I was able to read the writing on the inside of the patches where it shows through the paper. One patch is made up of colophon note about correction (勘了), another is a fragment of a Buddhist vernacular narrative, another is part of a Buddhist scripture. Has identifying pre-verse formula for <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span>.

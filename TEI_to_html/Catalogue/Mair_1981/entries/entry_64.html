              <span class="bibit">Poems of Brahmacārin Wang</span>, third scroll 王梵志詩卷第三 (end title; in different, more florid hand than that of text). Beginning torn. Colophon (same hand as end title): “Inscription set down in his own hand upon completion of copying by a monk of the Monastery of Golden Light on the ninth day of the fourth intercalary month of the year 938/942/950 (date is hopelessly corrupt).” 大漢天福參年庚戍歲潤(→閏)四月九日金光明寺僧自手建記寫畢. Second colophon: “Inscription by the monk, Ta-li, of the Monastery of Golden Light on the twenty-ninth day of the seventh month in the year 938/954 (this date also corrupt).” 大漢天福參年歲次甲寅七月廿九日金光明寺僧大力記. Practice writing, including beginning of Brahmacārin Wang’s <span class="bibit">Poems</span>. Ruled paper. Spare, fairly good hand; very few corrections.

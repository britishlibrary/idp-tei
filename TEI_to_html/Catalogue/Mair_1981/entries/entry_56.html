              <span class="bibit">Prosimetric story of Wu Tzu-hsü</span> (lacks title). Mediocre hand deteriorating to poor. Begins at the front edge of scroll near end of one verse portion (T7.4); sheets in front may have become detached. Stops at the end of another verse portion (12.4), but not because the copyist has run out of paper. Practice characters for a few inches; empty space of several inches. The copyist then takes up the story again in mid-sentence (T15.6.8) at the top edge of the scroll. Once again, he stops in mid-sentence at 17.10.32 and finally, after a space, he copies two lines from a later part of the story not in T. All of these disruptions seem purely arbitrary, the result of desultory practice copying. Lacks identifying <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span> formula.

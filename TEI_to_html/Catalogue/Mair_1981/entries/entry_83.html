              Exegetical text about the rebirth of Maitreya in the <span class="bibit">Tuṣita</span> heaven (lacks title). T646–655. There are 34 additional characters at the beginning of the ms that should have been included in the T text. These deal with the name “Maitreya,” the word “Bodhisattva,” and the Chinese proclivity for the abbreviation of Sanskrit words. Lacks identifying <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span> formula. Fairly good hand; very few corrections.

              “<span class="bibit"><span class="bibit">Nidāna</span> on the Ugly Girl</span>” 醜女<span class="bibit">緣起</span> (head title). T787–800.16. The T editors are probably incorrect in indicating the last line (“the transformation of ugliness that was told above” 上來所說醜變), which refers back to 798.2, to be some sort of title. The line in question occurs at the end of a verse passage. After it, the text breaks off abruptly at the end of a column because the sheet of paper ends. Subsequent sheets may have become detached. The characters in this line are the same size, shape, and placement as those in the rest of the text. The verse passages of this text are laid out in seven-character groups. The last line appears to be a deficient heptasyllabic line and could be completed with the addition of 媚 “alluring” (cf. 798.4). If pien in the final line were meant to be a genre, the grammar and syntax would be quite different. Lacks identifying <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span> formula. Lightly ruled. Mediocre hand; corrections, additions, and erasures.

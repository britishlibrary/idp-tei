          <span class="notheader">Section: v1</span><br>
            
              Long, prosimetric introduction to a popular lecture on the <span class="bibit">Amitābha-sūtra</span> 仏說阿彌陁經 (lacks title). T460–477. Clearly intended for oral delivery since it contains many such expressions as the following: “say ‘Buddhaputra’” 稱佛子, “sing” 唱, “listen” 聽, and so forth. Lacks identifying <span class="bibit">ya-tso-wen</span> and <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span> formulas but refers to sūtra lecture 講經 at 473.12. After this line comes a discussion of the title of the sūtra, as is normal in a <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span>. Before it is a prolix introduction that displays some features of certain <span class="bibit">ya-tso-wen</span> (such as the questions “Can you? Are you willing?” 能不能 願不願 addressed to the congregation) but which contains far more personal detail than any other known <span class="bibit">ya-tso-wen</span>. Rapid, moderately good hand.

              Prosimetric vernacular narrative about Maudgalyāyana’s search for his mother in hell (no title). T756–759. Rather dark beige paper. Large, fairly good hand; few corrections. Not a transformation text. First pre-verse formula is of the type “about that time, what may be said?” 當尔(=爾)之時有何言語. The other verse portions are not preceded by any particular identifying formula. The third section of verse is preceded by “Thereupon he leapt into the sky and went before his father whom he asked where his mother had gone.” 遂即騰身天上到於父前借問孃孃趣向甚處. The fourth section is preceded by “I hope that you do not begrudge your emotions and tell me where mother was reborn.” 願父莫惜情懷說母所生之處. In spite of the fact that these sentences end in “place” 處, in no way do they constitute the transformation text pre-verse formula because the word here has its literal meaning and does not signify narrative locus. At very beginning refers to an introduction that is lacking on this copy: 上來所說序分竟自下第二正宗者. Maudgalyāyana’s mother is here referred to as 靖提 instead of the usual 青提. Stops copying at T759.11 before text is finished, then jumps ahead to append the section beginning at 759.12 here but which ought to come much later in the story. Again, he stops copying without finishing.

              Upside-down in relation to the story on r°. Five records of monks, including those with position of <span class="bibit">Vinaya Master</span> <span class="bibit">法律</span> and <span class="bibit">Director of the Saṇgha</span> <span class="bibit">僧政</span>, who received cloth of various sorts for “singing” 唱. It is not clear what they sang. These notes are spaced evenly at intervals across the scroll. Title and name of monk in black, 唱 and type of cloth in red, how much received in black. The last individual received cloth on two occasions 唱 … 又唱. Probably the records of a fund-raising auction for a Buddhist monastery (cf. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Or.8210/S.4192</a>).

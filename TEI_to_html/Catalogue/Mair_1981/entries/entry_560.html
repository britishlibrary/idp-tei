          <span class="notheader">Section: 1</span><br>
            
              Semivernacular prosimetric narrative recounting of the eight major events in the Buddha’s life. First sheet of paper (begins T329.2) is rough, beige, and lightly ruled. Writing thereon is mediocre; many corrections; red ornaments and punctuation; generally messy. Second (begins 330.7) and succeeding sheets (to 342.7) are of still poorer, woody quality paper though the writing is slightly better and rapid; fewer corrections. Verse sections preceded by the abbreviated formula 云〻or by the full formula “at that time, what did he say?” 當爾之時道何言語 or some variation thereof. Note that the title, “<span class="bibit">Transformation on the Eight Manifestations</span>” 八相變, which is at the head of v°, is different from any of the hands used in copying the main text. The only other writing on v° is two practice characters.

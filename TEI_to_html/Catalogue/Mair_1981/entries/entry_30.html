              <span class="bibit">Transformation text on Wang Chao-chün</span>王昭君 (lacks title, torn at head). T98–107. Has identifying <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span> formula. There is no break in the scroll after the famous notation, “The first scroll that was set up and spread out is finished. From here we enter the second scroll.” 上卷立鋪畢此入下卷 (T100.12). This is supporting evidence for the claim that the scrolls here referred to are separate picture scrolls. Rather light beige paper of uneven quality and composition. Poor to fairly good hand; few additions, corrections, erasures. <span class="bibit">Family Teachings of the Grand Duke</span> (lack title) used as backing.

Main text for T714–744. Beige paper; lightly ruled; much used and worn. Mediocre, hurried hand; still some corrections even though the numerous extant compatible mss prove that this was already a relatively fixed text. Colophon (same hand, but more deliberate): “Written on the sixteenth day of the fourth month in the year 921 by Hsüeh An-chün, lay student of the Pure Land Monastery.” 貞明柒年辛巳歲四月十六日淨土寺學郎薛[#119](=安)俊寫. Some more writing just below this is no longer legible. Hsüeh An-chün was also the copyist of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Pelliot chinois 2054</a>. I discovered this connection by chance in 1974 and have recently been able to satisfy myself that the handwriting on the two mss is identical. Additional colophon (written by the copyist): “Chang Pao-ta’s ms” 張保達文書. This can not mean that the text was composed by Chang Pao-ta, as Giles asserts. Cf. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Pelliot chinois 2049</a>. Another line of a different text follows but is unreadable because it has been torn off straight down the whole width of the scroll. No trace of pictures. Has identifying <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span> formula.

              List of monks in the Pure Land Monastery. Practice writing, including this: “As for doing evil, no mention is made of what has been done by heaven.” 行[#120]不論天所造 (crossed out with light ink and followed by “crime” 罪 in same ink). Head title of r° repeated thrice in a very clumsy hand. Chang Pao-ta’s name is written after the first.

More corrections. Then another Buddhist narrative in classical. Colophon (in a different hand using red ink, upside-down after the seventh line from the end): “Written on the sixth day of the month of the <span class="bibit">i-mao</span> year (955?) by Chieh-ching, a monk of the Monastery of the Three Realms” 乙卯年七月六日三界寺僧戒淨寫耳.

              Semivernacular, prosimetric narrative recounting of the eight major events in the Buddha’s life. Coincides with and could have been used for collation of T329–342. Beige paper of poor quality; irregularly ruled. Several mediocre hands; very hurried toward end; red punctuation and highlighting in portions; many corrections; messy manuscript. Refrains (“Buddhaputra” 仏子) and abbreviations (云〻). Has the pre-verse formula “At that time, what did he say?” 當爾之時右(→有)何言語 or variations thereof. On v° is the following date: “fifteenth day of the fifth month in ping-wu year (946?)” 丙[#203](=午)年五月十五日.

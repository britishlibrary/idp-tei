              “<span class="bibit">Transformation Text on the Extreme Filial Piety of Shun as a Boy</span>,” one fascicle 舜子至孝變文一卷 (end title; torn at head). T130.11–134.12. Story of the miraculous ways the boy Shun is saved from the vicious plans of his stepmother to harm him. All in prose except for the very end which consists of two quatrains that are identical to those in the biographies of filial sons (T902.6–902.10). Immediately followed by quotations from texts that include biographical information on Shun (T134.13–135). Followed again by another text (in a different hand) consisting of vague personal comments on writing and learning. Colophon: “Inscribed on the fourteenth day of the fifth month of the year 949 (?) after completion of copying.” 天福十五年歲當己酉朱明蕤賓之月蓂生拾肆葉寫畢記. Finely drawn, uniform, nicely stylized calligraphy up to T134.15.2. From there to the end, including colophon, in a mediocre hand.

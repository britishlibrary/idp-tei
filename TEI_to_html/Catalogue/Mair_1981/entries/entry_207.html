              Illustrated transformation tableau (<span class="bibit">pien-hsiang</span> <span class="bibit">變相</span>) scroll for use in transformation (<span class="bibit">pien</span> <span class="bibit">變</span>) storytelling, i.e. storytelling with pictures. Unique and inestimably precious. Scenes on r° correspond exactly to those in the “<span class="bibit">Transformation Text on the Subjugation of Demons</span>” <span class="bibit">降魔變文</span> (T361–389), although the entire narrative does not survive on the present scroll. On v° of each scene are the verse portions (written in a mediocre hand with mistakes and corrections) of the transformation text which describe the episode depicted on r°. There are no prose passages on this scroll. Ordinary beige paper. The colored drawings exhibit a fairly high degree of technical skill and imagination. Especially to be noted is the artist’s deliberate employment of what I call the “continuous narrative” technique.

              Difficult to decipher notation (upside-down in relation to verse on v° and pictures on r°): “We gave up on little Master So at his seat. Yüan-ch’ang sought for but couldn’t get this. Wen-pin took care of things.” 丟却索师兒坐上(?)	[#86]昌覔(=覓)不得这(=這?)	文斌[#87](=料?)事. It is possible that this enigmatic notation refers to the means whereby the quondam owner(s) of this scroll came into possession of it. Yüan-ch’ang many be one of the inscribers of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Pelliot chinois 2633</a>. Wen-pin may be the official scribe who wrote <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Or.8210/S.2973</a> (dated the eight month of 970). The latter ms is a letter from the Chief Escort of the Military Governor and Overseer of Copyists Ma Wen-pin 節度押衙知司書手馬文斌 (so titled at head; cf. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Pelliot chinois 3726</a>v°). The letter and accompanying poem offer support for my surmise above (that Wen-pin was involved in the procurement of the illustrated transformation tableau scroll for storytelling now known as <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Pelliot chinois 4524</a>). Both the letter and the poem clearly display Wen-pin’s intense attraction for vivid, dynamic Buddhist art:<br>

                                I, the aforementioned Wen-pin, was accompanying your Honor while you stopped in this village when I saw a bejewelled elephant on a colourful wall-painting. Although I am not talented, I immediately composed a short poem made up of heptasyllabic verse with four rhymed couplets. I hereby respectfully present it to you with this letter, begging that you will favor it with you kind consideration when you read it. Respectfully I record the poem on this letter and present it to you in the form of previous respectful communications.<br>
                                Letter of the Chief Escort of the Military Governor and Overseer of Copyists, Ma Wen-pin, on the …th day of the eighth month of the year 970.
                                <p>The rare, bejewelled elephant is a king among beasts,<br>Throughout the world, there is no match for this fierce valor and heroic heart;<br>His four legs are planted as jade pillars,<br>His pair of tusks are sharp as the tip of a steel sword.<br>As he stands surveying the steep crags, he becomes a mountain,<br>When he moves, his swaying form terrifies the beholder;<br>Let his name alone be announced to evil types,<br>And they would not dare henceforth to create trouble.<br></p>

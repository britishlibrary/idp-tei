              Lay student copies from a printed text of the <span class="bibit">Vajracchedikāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra</span> (originating in Szechwan) into a booklet. Mediocre hand. Colophon (same hand): “On the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the year 943, the lay student Yin Yen-ch’ing made a vow to copy this respected sūtra with his own hand so that it may be transmitted to believers.” 大晉天福捌秊癸卯十一月十一日斈士郎陰彥清發心自手寫此尊經流傳士隹(→信士?). On back cover (same hand): “Hurriedly writ by my own hand the <span class="bibit">Diamond Sūtra</span>. On <span class="bibit">chia-wu</span>, I won’t end up having to drink the penalty wine.	With all my heart I support Shaka…ni. 	Sūtra.” 自手寫疾金剛經	<span class="bibit">甲午</span>不得喫罪[#64](→酒)境	一心供養[#65]阿	尼		經 (becomes more faint at end).<br>
     Translation note: the next year (843) was a <span class="bibit">chia-ch’en</span> year. <span class="bibit">Chia-wu</span> probably refers to a day, the twentieth of the eleventh month or nine days after the writing of the colophon. It would appear that Yin Yen-ch’ing’s writing assignment was due that day.

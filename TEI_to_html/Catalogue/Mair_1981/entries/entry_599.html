              On February 9, 1982, I learned of the existence of at least one additional copy of the <span class="bibit">transformation on Wang Ling</span> 王陵. It is owned by a private collector in China (whose name I am not liberty to divulge) and has not previously been noticed (cf. T47) in any account of Tun-huang materials. The collector informed me that he purchased the ms before the Cultural Revolution at the Cultural Relics Store 文物商店 in Peking. He described it to me as being a booklet of three or four pages of light beige paper. This accords well with other know transformations on Wang Ling (inventory items 147, 367, and 590). The collector told me that, when he was examining Tun-huang mss at the Cultural Relics Store, he saw one or two other copies similar to his but he could not buy them because the prices were very high. After the Cultural Revolution, cultural relics were no longer sold to private citizens and it is not clear what became of the Tun-huang mss at the Cultural Relic Store. Perhaps these are the “one thousand or so uncatalogued mss” in the basement of the Peking National Library that came into the hands of the Chinese authorities “since the Revolution.” But I know for a fact that many private collectors in China secretly retain Tun-huang mss that came into their possession both before and after the Revolution. The history of the discovery and dispersal of the Tun-huang cave library shows that there was ample opportunity for many of the mss to be sold or pilfered even before Stein, Pelliot, Ol’denburg, Otani, and the Ch’ing government carted off the major portions. I suspect now that there may be as many as one or two thousand mss not yet accounted for. Among these, there is likely to be about a dozen items that include popular literary texts. I am delighted to have located one of them, but it is ironic (after my round-the-world trip) that I did so in Philadelphia. As soon as the owner can make photographs of the ms available to me, I will publish it in an appropriate journal.

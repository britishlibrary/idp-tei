              Titles: “<span class="bibit">A Record of a Pair of Kindnesses</span>,” third [fascicle] 䨥(=雙)㤙(=恩)記第三 (head). “<span class="bibit">A Record of a Pair of Kindnesses</span>,” seventh [fascicle] 雙㤙記弟七 (1. 238). <span class="bibit">The Buddha’s Sūtra of the Recompense for Kindness</span>, seventh [fascicle] 佛報恩経弟七 (1. 460). <span class="bibit">Sūtra of Recompense for Kindness</span>, eleventh [fascicle] 報㤙経弟十一 (1. 461). The <span class="bibit">Buddha’s Sūtra of the Recompense for Kindness</span>, eleventh [fascicle] 佛報恩経弟十一 (end). A variant type of sūtra lecture text. At least partially based on the <span class="bibit">Sūtra of Recompense for Kindness</span> 報恩經 (see 11. 129–130). Not in T. Has identifying <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span> formula but it does not always occur regularly at the end of verse passages. Also has greater variety of verse forms than typical <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span>. Soft, white paper; irregularly ruled. In three (?) mediocre hands: first is thick, halting, blockish; second (starting at 1. 238 where there is a seam between two sheets of paper) is somewhat neater; third is quick, spidery, attenuated. Full of errors; very few corrections and additions.

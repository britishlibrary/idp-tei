              “<span class="bibit">Discussion of Tea and Wine</span>,” one fascicle, with preface 茶酒論一卷并序 (head title; end title drops 并序). Composed by Wang Yao(→Fu), Graduate of the Third Provincial Examination. 鄉貢進士王[#81](→敷)撰. T267–269.9(卷). Very poor hand; corrections, additions, erasures. Head colophon (in different, very poor hand): “Written by ‘Slaveboy’ Yin and Chieh-jung (?) on the eighteenth day of the first month of the <span class="bibit">chi-mao</span> year (979).” 巴[#82](=己卯)年正月十八日陰奴兒[#83](=界榮?)[#84](=寫). ‘Slaveboy’ Yin is the same lay student who figures so prominently in the inscriptions on <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Or.8210/S.5441</a>. Two children’s textbooks. “<span class="bibit">Lament of the Woman of Ch’in</span>” by the Ommissioner, Wei Chuang 秦婦吟	補闕[#85]莊撰 (head title and designation of author). End colophon of entire booklet; “Copied with his right(→own) hand by Chao Yüan-chu, <span class="bibit">[śrā]maṇera</span> of the Pure Land Monastery, on the sixth day of the second month of the <span class="bibit">kuei-wei</span> year (983).” 癸未年二月六日淨土寺[沙]彌趙員住右[→自]手書之.<br>
Note that this novice uses his lay, rather than religious, name. Semiliterate repetition of the end colophon. Doodles in margins of booklet. Cover is crammed with scribbles and largely illegible inscriptions. Thick paper; clumsily ruled.

              Manual for writing letters. Very badly damaged; lightly ruled. Fairly good hand. Colophon (somewhat incoherent; same hand): “Retained and inscribed copied on the sixteenth day of the second month of the year 940 by the lay student, Wu Ju-hsien (‘Confucian-Sage’), for reading and recitation.” 天福伍年庚子歲二月十六日學士郎吳儒賢詩(→持)記寫耳續(→讀 or without emendation in the sense of “continued by”)頌[#67](sic).

              Lay society circulars (poor to very poor hands). Next to one of them: “Inscribed with brush by Fan An-te, lay student of the Pure Land Monastery.” 淨土寺斈士郎𠖰安徳筆記. Mention of the year 978.

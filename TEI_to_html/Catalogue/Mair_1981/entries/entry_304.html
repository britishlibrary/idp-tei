The aforementioned notice is being circulated because ‘Lone Slave’ P’ei has lost his wife. People are getting together to make a contribution, each giving one pint of flour, one-tenth pint of oil, a peck of grain, a bundle of firewood, and three ten-foot lengths of finished thin silk and colored goods. We are inviting all of you gentlemen. This circular sets a limit of 5–7 a.m. on the twenty-second of this month. We will gather in front of the gate of the office building. The last two to arrive will be caught and fined a cup of wine. Those who fail to come altogether will be fined half a jar of wine. Encourage each other to pass the circular along speedily. Do not delay it. If there is someone who delays it, he will be punished in accordance with the regulations. When the circular has gone all the way around, send it back to the originating (i.e. this) office to be used as evidence for the announcement of penalties.

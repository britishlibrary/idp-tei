              Peking University Library uncatalogued ms (booklet).	 “<span class="bibit">Transformation on the Han General, Wang Ling</span>” 漢將王陵變 (head title). T36.1–37.14.21. Light beige paper of very poor quality; irregularly ruled, six lines per page. Very poor hand. Cover: beginnings of lay society circulars; “Written the twentieth day of the ninth month of the year 921 by Ch’ih(?) Han(?)-tzu” 辛巳年九月二十日[#221]憨子寫[#222]寫. Cf. “Silly Chang” on <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Or.8210/S.5632</a>. First page, in an execrable hand, practice writing of the title four times. Second page is the beginning of the transformation text. Eighth page ends in mid-sentence: “opened the storehouse and presented them with two carved bows and precious” 開庫賜彫弓兩張寶 (T36.10.18). A double-layered glued-together page has come apart at this point and the two formerly blank pages that were exposed have been used to practice writing (mediocre hand): “978. Escort An. Escort An. Inscription of writing by So Ch’ing-tzu, lay student of the bibliographic secretary. If later someone should read this, please do not blame me.” 太平興國三年	[#223]		子	安 拍 牙	[#224]		[#225]		安押衙	孔目官斈仕郎索清子書記耳	後有人讀誦者請莫怪也了也. The second formerly blank page has practice writing of dates in two different hands, scribbles, and other practice characters. Page nine begins in mid-sentence, “arrows, two hundred, gave to the two important officials” 箭二百集分与二大臣 (T36.10.19). Stops copying on page 13 at T37.14.21. Has identifying pre-verse formula for <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span>.

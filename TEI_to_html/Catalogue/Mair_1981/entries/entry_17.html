              <span class="bibit">Sūtra lecture text on the <span class="bibit">Lotus Sūtra</span></span> (lacks title). T488-500. Fairly good, drab paper. Fairly good hand. Very few corrections and additions. Had identifying <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span> formula.

              A series of exhortations by a preacher to his congregation, largely heptasyllabic verse, to take to heart the teachings of the sūtras (especially the <span class="bibit">Inconstancy Sūtra</span> 无常經) and to come often to the “lecture courtyard” 講院 to hear him elucidate them. T656–670. Slightly better than average hand. Lacks <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span> identifying formula.

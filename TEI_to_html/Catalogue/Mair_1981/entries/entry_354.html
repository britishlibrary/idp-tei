              Inscription and preface. Poem. <span class="bibit">Gāthās</span>. Prayer. Vows. Eulogy. “<span class="bibit">The Marvels of Shun as a Boy</span>,” one scroll 舜子變一卷 (head title). Used in collation of T129–130.10. Lacks identifying <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span> formula; is entirely in vernacular prose. Then questions and answers on Buddhist doctrine. Story of the Buddha. Prayer. Poems. Vow. Other miscellaneous texts and documents. Beige paper; various poor to mediocre hands. This scroll composed of separate sheets with separate texts on them pasted together. Generally very messy; corrections, additions, erasures. The copying of the story about Shun stops abruptly before coming to the end of the sheet it is on.

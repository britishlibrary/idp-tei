              “<span class="bibit">The Story of the Crown Prince of the House of Liu during the Former Han</span>,” <span class="bibit">前漢劉家太子傳</span> (head title). “<span class="bibit">Marvels of the Crown Prince of the Liu Family</span>,” one fascicle 劉家太子變一卷 (end title). T160¬–163. Semivernacular prose; lacks identifying <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span> formula. Followed immediately in same hand by “Poetic Recitation on Chi Pu” 季布詩詠 (head title). T844–845. The piece is actually about Chang Liang. Then later “<span class="bibit">The Story of the Crown Prince of the House of Liu during the Former Han</span>” 前漢劉家太子傳 (different hand, begins abortively to copy the text again). This surely is the correct title (cf. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Or.8210/S.5547</a>). The end title above must be considered an aberration. Poor quality beige paper with reddish tint; faintly ruled. Nondescript, mediocre hand; uncorrected. Several eulogies also on this scroll, r° and v°.

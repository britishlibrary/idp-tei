              “<span class="bibit">Transformation Text on Mahāmaudgalyāyana</span>,” one scroll 大目犍連變文一卷 (title at end). Beginning missing because a glued-on sheet of paper has become detached. Inconsistent, ill-formed, poor hand; corrections, additions, erasures. Irregularly ruled. Ruling stops at end of sections and is followed by large empty spaces which were probably originally intended for pictures. The sequence is thus prose, verse, blank spaces; prose, verse, blank space; and so on. The beginning of each section is marked in the top margin by a circle. First fully visible characters are at T732.10.3; first section, consisting of 46 lines of writing and 5 unfilled lines, ends at 737.1 and is followed by a space 38¼” long. The second section, consisting of 10 lines of writing and one unfilled line, begins at 737.2, ends at 738.2, and is followed by 9⅞” of space. The third section, consisting of 11 lines, begins at 738.3, ends at 739.7.9, and is followed by a space that is 11⅞” in length. The fourth section, consisting of 16 filled and 6 unfilled lines, begins at 739.9, ends at 741.5, and is followed by 4⅕” of space. The fifth section, consisting of 19 lines of writing and 3 empty lines, begins at 741.6, ends at 743.5, and is followed by 5⅞” of empty space. The sixth section, consisting of 9 lines of writing, begins at 743.6, ends at 743.12, and is followed by 5⅛” of empty space. The seventh and last section, consisting of 18 lines of writing, begins at 743.13, ends at 744.12, and is followed by the title in one line (see below), two empty lines, and 7⅛” of space. Colophon (in same hand as the main text): “On the fifth day of the intercalary sixth month in the second, <span class="bibit">ting-ch’ou</span>, year of the Peace and Prosperity reign period [i.e., August 22, 977], the lay scholar Yang Yüan-shou of the Manifest Virtue Temple, having pondered the matter by himself, made a vow to create blessings by writing in full this <span class="bibit">Transformation on Maudgalyāyana</span> in one scroll. It is his determination that, in the future, together with Śākyamuni Buddha, he shall be reborn a Buddha once he encounters Maitreya. If, later, there are individuals who, expressing a similar faith, write out in full the <span class="bibit">Transformation on Maudgalyāyana</span> and similarly maintain the power of their vow, they will avoid falling upon the three paths of hell.” 太平興國二年歲在<span class="bibit">丁㺭(=丒)</span>潤(→閏)六月五日顯德寺學仕郎楊[#191](=願)受一人思[#192] //發願㑅(=作)福[#193][#194]此目連變一卷後同釋迦[#195]尼佛壹會弥勒生作仏//為[#196](=定)		後有衆生同發信心[#197]盡目連變者同池(→持)[#198]力莫墮三途.

              “<span class="bibit">One Layout of the Transformation on Wang Ling in Which, during the Eighth Year of the Han Dynasty, Ch’u Is Destroyed and Han Gains the Ascendancy</span>” 漢八年楚滅漢興王陵變一鋪 (end title, in same hand as text). The word “layout” in the title refers to a picture scroll used by transformation storytellers as a visual aid. T36.8.16(帝)–47.1. Ends abruptly with “enfeoffed ten thousand households” 封万戶, then starts to write the title <strike>漢</strike>{X}{X} but crosses it out before writing it again (as given above). Has identifying <span class="bibit">pien-wen</span> formula. Booklet of ordinary, light beige paper; faintly ruled. Fairly good hand; few corrections. Colophon (on a separate line and in a different hand): “Inscription of copying by the Bibliographic Secretary, Yen Wu-ch’eng, on the sixteenth day of the eighth month of the year 939.” 天福四年八月十六日孔目官閻物成寫記. Followed immediately by miscellaneous local documents in different, mostly poor hands and from different times.

              <span class="bibit">Analects</span>, ch. 7. Fairly good hand; red punctuation; some corrections. Colophon (poorer hand, unlikely to be by the copyist): “Inscription of writing on the twenty-second day of the third month in the year 855 by the student, Ling-hu Tsai-sheng”大中九[年]三月廿二日斈生令狐再晟寫記. Additional colophon (in a different, very poor hand): “Inscription of copying on the twelfth day of the fourth month in the year 864 by the youth, Ling-hu Wen-chin.”咸通五年四月十二[日]童子令狐文進書記. In still another hand: “Hai Yüan-ya”海源𢘉(=押?).

              “<span class="bibit">Story of the Capture of Chi Pu</span>,” one scroll 捉季布傳文一卷 (head title). <span class="bibit">“Lyric Text of the Ch’u General, Chi Pu, Cursing the King of Han at the Battlefront in the Third Year of the Great Han Dynasty [204 B.I.E.], Putting Him to Shame before All His Ministers and Causing Him to Pull back His Horse and Withdraw His Troops.”</span> 大漢三年楚將季布罵陣漢王羞耻羣臣拔馬收軍詞文 (subtitle). T51–71.4. Completely in heptasyllabic verse. At bottom of end of scroll: Shu-heng [#68](=庶)恆, probably the owner or the copyist. At front edge of scroll, someone other than the copyist hand started to write out the subtitle (up to 罵). This is partially covered by a fragment of Buddhist verse that has been pasted on top of it. The last two lines of verse (71.4: “All I have told was formulated in the Han History; Don’t say that the lyricist has sung untruly.” 具說漢書修製了莫道詞人唱不眞) are set apart from the rest. Elaborately ruled (three large horizontal rows and columns); fairly neat ms. Fairly good hand; few corrections. Clearly a relatively fixed text.

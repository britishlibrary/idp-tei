              Beginning part of the story of Wu Tzu-hsü (lacks title). T1–2.12. Fairly good hand; corrections, additions, erasures. In T1.3 (昔周國欲末六雄競起八{方}), the ms has no other character in the next space after 八. This line is written about 1/5th of the way down from the top of the page and in larger characters than what follows. It would appear that the copyist originally intended these then characters to be part of a title. Begins at the very edge of a new sheet of paper. Copyist stops abruptly one-third of the way into a line, not because he has run out of space of because paper has been torn off. After a couple of empty lines, someone else has taken up the available space to write on a completely different theme. Typical Buddhist texts in two mediocre hands. Beige paper with reddish tinge; first two sheets poor quality, second two ordinary.

              Documents relating to sacrificial ceremonies. Fairly good hands; some corrections.

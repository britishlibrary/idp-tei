              Lay society circular mentioning fines to be imposed and listing names of members, including officers, one of whom is Yang Yüan-shou 楊願受. Yang was responsible for the writing of this circular, his post being the “official of society circulars” 帖社(reverse order?)官. Dated the fourteenth day of the first month of the <span class="bibit">keng-ch’en</span> <span class="bibit">庚辰</span> year (980). Very light beige paper; a separate small sheet attached to the main scroll. Poor to mediocre hand. Yang Yüan-shou is the copyist of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">BD00876: 6</a> (dated 977), a “<span class="bibit">Transformation Text on Mahāmaudgalyāyana</span>.” <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">BD00876</a> and this lay society circular are by the same distinctive, thick, somewhat blockish hand using very black ink. Most of the characters here can be matched perfectly with their counterparts in <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">BD00876</a>. Some slight improvement in this circular over the time he was a lay student three years before. <span class="bibit">Vinaya</span> rules for nuns. Poor hand.

              At beginning edge:  { }文題. The first character, only partly legible, might be an unusual simplified form of pien 變(変) but is too indistinct to be certain. If it were pien, this would then mean “title of a transformation text (<span class="bibit">pien-wen</span>)” and might refer to a text that has been torn off the front of r. Many practice characters by Sung and others. Local documents. Signatures include that of the commoner, Lu Chung-ta 百姓盧忠達. Lay society circulars. Most of the writing on v is very childish and messy.

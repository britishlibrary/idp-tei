              Pao-ta保達, identified as a member of the “company of disciples”徒衆, signs his name to a report on the disbursements and receipts of the Pure Land Monastery淨土寺. Dated the first month of 925. May be the same person as the quondam owner of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Or.8210/S.2614</a>. The signature appears to be that of someone who is barely literate. Based on the scanty information that is available, Pao-ta — like the copyist of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Or.8210/S.2614</a>, Hsüeh An-chün — must have been a layman who was deeply involved in the affairs of the monastery and who was actively engaged in learning about Buddhism.

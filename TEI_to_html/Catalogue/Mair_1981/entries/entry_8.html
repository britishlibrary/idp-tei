              “<span class="bibit"><span class="bibit">Vimalakīrti[-sūtra]</span> Seat-Settling Text</span>” <span class="bibit">維摩</span>押座文 (head title). Used in collation of T829–823. Has identifying <span class="bibit">ya-tso-wen</span> formula and the refrain “<span class="bibit">Buddhaputra</span>” <span class="bibit">佛子</span>. Followed immediately by heptasyllabic verses on the <span class="bibit">Vimalakīrti-sūtra</span> (lack title). T589–591. There is a long, clear break after T590.4 in which are written, upside-down, notes on the <span class="bibit">Vimalakīrti-sūtra</span> (these occur, at intervals, across v° in a fairly good, rapid hand). The section following is labeled “Chapter on <span class="bibit">upāya</span>” <span class="bibit">方便</span>品. Lacks indentifying formula for <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span>. Then a sūtra lecture text for part of the <span class="bibit">Amitābha-sūtra</span>. “<span class="bibit">Bitter Lament of Hell</span>” 地獄苦吟 (head title). Main text for the collation of T482–486. Has identifying formula for <span class="bibit">chiang-ching-wen</span>. Many evidences of oral peformamce: “What follows is spoken” 此下白道. “Continuing the lecture” 講下. “Sing it clearly in the <span class="bibit">shang</span> mode” 清涼<span class="bibit">商</span>調唱將來. “What follows is the singing of the <span class="bibit">sūtra</span>” 此下唱<span class="bibit">經</span>, etc. Also has the refrain “<span class="bibit">Buddhaputra</span>” <span class="bibit">佛子</span>. The three main texts on v° are in mediocre hands. Punctuation, additions, corrections, erasures.

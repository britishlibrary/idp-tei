                false;">Pelliot chinois 3910</a>. Additional note, partially erased but reconstructed: “{Donkey Yin} sang incorrectly” {陰}{驢}子錯唱. This note is based on the last line of the text (T71.4b): “Don’t say that the lyricist has sung untruly” 莫道詞人唱不眞. N.B.: This final line and the end title are in a good hand. All the rest is in a poor, unpracticed hand, including the colophon and the additional note. Followed by Brahmacārin Wang’s poems. Coarse, brownish beige paper. Childish practice characters and numbers in margins; doodles throughout. Erasures, corrections. A very messy, very crude ms; clearly the work of a beginning student. The cover of this copybook is full of scribbles, some of which are very faint and extremely difficult to decipher: 
                                    “<span class="bibit">Wu-yin</span> year (978). The one who writes the later inscriptions is a chronicler (?). Inscription of copying by ‘Slaveboy’ Yin on the twenty-fifth day of the second month in the year 978. On the seventeenth day of the second month of 978, T’ien Chi-ch’ang, Li Ying-shao, and ‘Donkey’ Yin. Li Ying-shao’s tongue (?), personal achievements, determination, ability, and writing brush, being clumsy and mean, are to be cursed. Written in his own hand. Should Secretary Fan later some one day and recite this by himself, all the more do not blame. The year’s (?) too early — because (?) of a big (?) wind (?). Inscription of the completion of writing (?) together by the two lay students of Secretary (?) Fan, T’ien Wen-chi and Li Ying-shao, on the tenth day of the second month in 978. Second month of 978. Second month of 978. 978. Inscription of the writing in his own hand of one fascicle of characters by ‘Slave Boy’ Yin on the seventeenth day of the second month in 978. Inscription of the copying in his own hand of ‘<span class="bibit">Chi Pu</span>,’ one fascicle, by reckless (?) ‘Slaveboy’ Yin on the twentieth day of the second month in 9 8.”

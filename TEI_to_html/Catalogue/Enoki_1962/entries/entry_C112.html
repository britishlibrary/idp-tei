              Vol. 72, fol. 72; 62 c. x 31 c.: 13 columns, (a) 2, (b) 3, (c) 8, lower halves missing: (a) and (c) probably the same hand.<br>
              (a) A part of a memorandum concerning provisions(?) supplied to the Shang-shu ping-ma (shih?) who was going to the east, which runs as follows:<br>
              1. -----/...<br>
              2. ----/...<br>
            <br>

            <span class="bibit">([unknown]</span><br>
            
              (b) A part of a memorandum written by another hand than (a) and (c), concerning supply of provisions to the T'u-hun people at the time when the Shang-shu ping-ma went to the east. The text runs as follows:<br>
              1. ----/...<br>
              2. ----/...<br>
              3. ----/...<br>

              (c) A part of a memorandum, pasted upside-down, concerning the consumption of rice, flour, and wheat. In the first column the date is given as Ch'ien-ning ting-ssŭ (A.D. 897). This may also indicate the date when (a) and (b) were written. The MSS. probably refer to the embassies sent to the Chinese court from Tun-huang. On these embassies see Naba (Toshisada), On the shê-i established by the Buddhists during the latter half of the T'ang, Shirin, XXIV, 1939, p. 778, and Fujieda (Akira), A history of Sa-chou Kuei-chün Chieh-tu-shih, Tôhô Gakuhô, Kyoto, 1942, pp. 520 ff. The fragment (c) runs as follows:<br>
              1. .../-----<br>
              2. .../----<br>
              3. ...(five letters, which follow, can not be deciphered).<br>
              4. ...<br>
              5. ...<br>
              6. ...<br>
              7. ...<br>
              8. ...<br>

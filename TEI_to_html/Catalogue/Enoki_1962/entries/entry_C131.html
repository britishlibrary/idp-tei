              The contents of this MS. ('the Long Scroll') are described by W. Simon, A Note on Chinese Texts in Tibetan Transcription, B.S.O.A.S. XXI, 1958, pp. 334-43, where ll. 1-6 recto are retranscribed into Chinese. Ll. 90-94, the initial part of the Treatise on Zen by Bodhidharma, are identical with Pelliot MS. no. 1228, which is also retranscribed by Simon, ibid., pp. 341-2. See also F. W. Thomas, S. Miyamoto, and G. L. M. Clauson, A Chinese Mahāyāna Catechism in Tibetan and Chinese Characters, J.R.A.S., 1929, pp. 37-76, for a comparison of the portion of the text parallel to Ch. 80. XI (C93) and a photograph of ll. 1-14 recto. A retranscription into Chinese characters by Kuno (Hôryû) is finished or nearly finished for the following lines: recto, 4-46, 90-117, 215-22, 262-7, 278-90; verso, 46-52, 92-95, 115-96.<br>

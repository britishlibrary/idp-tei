              Ch. 82. XI. 1, a fragment of scroll, 26 c. x 45 c.: 5 characters: Tibetan, scribbling in several hands.<br>
              The five characters are Ti wu shih liu chih. 'The 56th bundle.' This must have been a wrapping paper of a bundle of MSS. A chih or a wrapper of a bundle of MSS. or book in scrolls was usually a sort of bamboo-blind covered with silk cloth. But in this case paper was used instead probably for the reason of simlicity or of economy. Concerning the chih cf. Yê Te-hui, Shu-lin ch'ing-hua, fasc. 1; Naba (Toshisada), Shochitsu no rekishi, Rekishi to Chiri, XIX, nos. 3-5; Nagasawa (Kikuya), Kanseki Kaidai, Pt. 1, Tokyo, 1933, p. 5; id., Shina shoseki shôshi, Shoshigaku, I, 1939, no. 5, p. 24; Giles, B.S.O.S.A.S. XI, p. 157; Seiiki Kōko Zufu, vol. II (1). 2. In the Musée Guimet some originals of 'chih' are available (EO 1200, ...; EO 1208; EO 1209).<br>

              Probably written by way of pasttime. The meaning is not so clear. 'The banana-tree brings forth bananas, the bamboo bamboo shoots. The swift steed becomes pregnant. Such are harmful to themselves (i. e. to banana-tree, bamboo, and the swift steed). Profit, nourishment, and honour are things which the foolish are very fond of. But they can injure the good doctrine (shan-fa). These things will be compared to a sword which cuts off one's head.'<br>

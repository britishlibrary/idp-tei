              Ch. 86. II back, Scroll; 26 c. x 27 c.: 6 columns (4+2)+ll. 12 Tibetan.<br>
              In Chinese characters are inscribed the title, the name of the author with his official title, and the beginning of the Ch'ien-tzŭ-wên. For the Ch'ien-tzŭ-wên see Pelliot, Le Ts'ien tseu wen ou 'Livre du mille mots', T.P. XXIV, 1926, pp. 179-214, 293. Four MSS. of the work are available in the Stein collection at the British Museum (Giles, Descriptive Catalogue, nos. 2824, 7153, 7166, 7273).<br>
              The blank space before the Chinese title and between the title and beginning of the text has been filled by a Tibetan scribe, probably by way of writing practice, with brief notes on Buddhist topics (the eightfold way, etc.). The first two lines of Tibetan writing are, however, a transcription of the Chinese text:<br>
              tshyan dzi bun [...] chig [...] 'wen [...] 'gwa [...] san [...] gi [...] shi [...] lang [...] ce'u [...] hing [...] si [...] dzi [...] 'win [...] then [...] de [...] hwan [...] hwang [...]

                                <span class="smaller"> [note: The Chinese characters are given by the cataloguer.] </span><br>
              The Ch'ien-tzŭ-wên in Tibetan script in the Pelliot Collection at the Bibliothèque Nationale (P. 3419) is well known and has been published and studied by Haneda (Tôru), Bankan Taion Sen-jimon no dankan Tôyô Gakuhô, XIII, 1923, pp. 390-410 (with photographs of the text) and Tonkô Isho, 1926, Tokyo; by Lo Ch'ang-p'ei, T'ang Wu-tai Hsi-pei fang-yin (Academia Sinica. The National Research Institute of History and Philology Monographs, Ser. A, no. 12), Shanghai, 1933; and by Zaitsu (Aizô) Tonkôshutsudo kanzô taion no zairyô to Inkyô tono hikaku, Pt. 1, Tôŷôgaku Sôhen, vol. 1, 1934, Tokyo, pp. 105-53. Cf. also mentions made by Pelliot in J.A. XIX, 1912, pp. 584, 589-90, By Maspero in B.E.F.E.O. XX. ii, pp. 21, 32, 37, 41, 46-50, and by W. Simon in B.S.O.A.S. XXI. 2, 1958, p. 334.<br>

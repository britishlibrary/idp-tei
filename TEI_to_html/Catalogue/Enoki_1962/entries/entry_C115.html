              Ch. 1292 (5); 5 columns, (a) 2, (b) 3: two fragments used to patch the paper for the Tibetan text recto.<br>
              These two pieces are a part of the same document, which seems to be a sort of circular of a club established by Buddhist monks (nuns?). The bottom of fragment (a) combines with the top of fragment (b). In (b) the following names are deciphered: Miao-wu, Shan-man, Pan-shêng-chüeh, Pao-chu.<br>

              Ch. I. 0021a, Kh. scroll; 81 c. x 31 c.: 15 columns (4+8+3).<br>
              Three registers of sheep in the year chia-shên. (a) is the registration of the number of sheep under the care of a shepherd named So Shêng-chu who has the title of Tu-t'ou, prepared on the 23rd day of the 6th month of the (sexagenary) year of chia-shên. (b) was prepared on the 11th day of the 2nd month of the year chia-shên for the sheep under the care of shepherd Tsao Yun(?)-an. This is said to be the 'Actual registration of the number of sheep surviving the period of invasion of several enemies, who were driven away'. And (c) was prepared on the 1st day of the 3rd month of the year of chia-shên for the sheep under the care of shepherd X (name is not deciphered) that 'survived the second invasion of enemy, who was driven away'. So chronologically they must be arranged in the order of (b), (c), and (a). The year chia-shên (924? or 984?) cannot be exactly identified for the moment. In the British Museum five MSS. of a similar nature are available (cf. Giles, Descriptive Catalogue, nos. 7744-8).<br>

              Ch. 83. XI (754 part); 24 columns in seven parts: (a) 6: (b) 4: (c) 1: (d) 3: (e) 2: (f) 3: (g) 1: (h) 4: between (a) and (b), (f) and (g), and (g) and (h) are inserted three letters in Tibetan: (c) is written upside down in a different hand from the others.<br>
              F. W. Thomas, A Chinese Buddhist Pilgrim's Letters of Introduction, J.R.A.S., 1927, p. 547 and n. 1, p. 548.<br>
              It seems that the Chinese texts (a)-(h) are memoranda taken by a Chinese Buddhist monk of high reputation, who is called ho-shang (hva.śan) in the Tibetan letters of introduction above mentioned and who was going to Nālanda from Wu-t'ai-shan via Leṅ-cu

                                <span class="smaller"> [note: Leṅ-cu is probably identical with Ling-chou, and not with Lan-chou as was suggested by Thomas (J.R.A.S., 1927, p. 548). According to the Hsi-t'ien lu-ching (British Museum, S. 383, Giles, Descriptive Catalogue, no. 7142), which is an itinerary from Tung-ching (not Lo-yang as Giles says, but the capital of Sung (960-1127) or what is now K'ai-fêng) to Nālanda, one went to Ling-chou, Kan-chou, Su-chou, Yü-mên-kuan, Sa-chou, and so on. Concerning Tsoṅ-ka, wherefrom Tsoṅ-kha-pa (bTsoṅ-kha-pa) came, see my note in the Môko Gakuhô, i, 1913, pp. 149-50. Cf. also G. Devéria, Histoire des Collèges des Interprètes de Péking, 1896, p. 41 n. 22.] </span>, Kam-cu, and Sa-cu or Tun-huang. But (c), which consists of three characters Lung-hing-ssǔ, is obviously written by a man who was likely to have suggested the visit by this ho-shang to Lung-hsing-ssŭ temple at Tun-huang (as for Lung-hsing-ssŭ see Giles, Descriptive Catalogue, Index). The content of these memoranda is almost incomprehensible except that of (d) which is a mantra transcribed in Chinese characters. Anyway, the Chinese texts have no direct concern with Tibetan letters of introduction, Tsoṅ-ka being the only proper name which is common to both Chinese text (h) and Tibetan letter (B). As for the Tibetan letters see Thomas's article referred to above.

              Written from left to right. It seems that the text concerns praying to Buddha for good luck in the future and in the travel of an embassy of Khotan sent to Tun-huang under the rule of Chang Chin-shan. The sexagenary year Jên-wu in the text almost certainly corresponds to A.D. 922 and this proves the existence of the kingdom of Chin-shan in this year. As for the kingdom of Chin-shan cf. Wang (Chung-min), Chin-shan-kuo chui-shih ling-shih (Historical fragments concerning the kingdom of Chin-shan), Kuo-li Pei-p'ing-t'u-shu-kuan kuan-k'an, vol. 9, no. 6; Naba (Toshisada), Shirin, vol. 24, pp. 508, 510-11; Fujieda (Akira), Tôhô Gakuhô, Kyôtô, vols. 12 and 13.<br>

              Fragment 57 (465); 74 columns (the first 15 incomplete).<br>
              A part of a sūtra telling the story of King Ajātaśatru who, having killed his father and mother, was converted to a very faithful beliver in Buddhism. The name of the king is given as Shan-chien or as P'o-lo-liu-pa i.e. Balaruci (pa is a scribal error for chih), the name of Varśakāra, the minister who helped the king in plotting against his father, as Yü-hsing, and the name of the king's mother as P'i-t'i. No identical text is found in the existing sūtras relating to Ajātaśatru. Cf. Mochizuki, Bukkyô Daijiten, under Ajasei ô; Akanuma (Chizen), Indo Bukkyô Koyûmeishi Jiten, pp. 10-12; Ono (Genmyo), Bukkyô no Bijuṭsu oyobi Rekishi, pp. 386 ff.; Yabuki, Meisa Yoin Kaisetsu, Pt. 2, pp. 71-75.<br>

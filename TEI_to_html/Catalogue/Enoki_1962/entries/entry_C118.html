              Fragment 58 (756); 42 columns, including titles.<br>
              The full title reads Hsien-hsien Chou-kung Chieh-mêng-shu i chüan ping Hsü (Book of Dream Reading in one fascicule written by Chou-kung, ancient sage, with a preface). The preface consists of 23 columns and the main text of 12. The main text includes the whole of the T'ien-pu Ti-i (Section 1, [Dreams] relating to the sky), which is followed merely by the title of Ti-pu Ti-êrh (Section 2, [Dreams] relating to the earth), the rest being left blank. It is, therefore, very obvious that the text is unfinished. In the Stein Collection at the British Museum there are three MSS. of 'Book of Dream Reading' (Giles, Descriptive Catalogue, nos. 6978-80), but none of them is identical with the present text. Only no. 6980 (S. 5900), which is stated to have been compiled from the Chou-kung Chieh-mêng-shu in 20 chapters, is similar to the present text in its content. In the Pelliot Collection at the Bibliothèque Nationale five MSS. entitled Chou-kung Chieh-mêng-shu are available (P. 2829, 3105, 3281, 3685, 3908, 3990).<br>

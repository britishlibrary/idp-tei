              Ch. 00120, Scroll; 234 c. x 25 c.: ll. 23+70 Chinese in Brāhmī script.<br>
              (a) The initial 23 lines, which are 'Introductory prayers' to the Vajracchedikā, were published by H. W. Bailey, Vajra-prajñā-pāramitā, Z.D.M.G. CXII, 1938, pp. 582-3. Among them, ll. 1-11 are identical with the text printed in the Taisho, LXXXV, no. 2732, p. 1a(23)-1b(5); ll. 11-19 with that in the Dainihon Zoku-Zôkyô, 2nd series, B, fasc. 2, p. 131a(b15)-b(a3); and ll. 19-23, with ibid., p. 131b(b4-b8). The identification of the Chinese text of this portion follows W. Simon, A Note on Chinese Texts in Tibetan Transcription, B.S.O.A.S. XXI, 1958, p. 335 n.3.<br>
              (b) The text of the Vajracchedikā, which starts from the 24th line, is printed in the Taisho, VIII, no. 235, pp. 748c(18)-749b(18). The identification of the Chinese text and its study were published by F. W. Thomas, A Buddhist Chinese Text in Brâhmî Script, Z.D.M.G. XCI, 1937, pp. 1-48, together with a fine reproduction of the text in 3 plates. For further particulars see H. W. Bailey's article mentioned above, F. W. Thomas, Notes in Consideration of Professor Bailey's Critical Observations, Z.D.M.G. XCII, 1938, pp. 594-604, and Postscripts by Bailey and Thomas, ibid., pp. 605-6, 606-10.<br>

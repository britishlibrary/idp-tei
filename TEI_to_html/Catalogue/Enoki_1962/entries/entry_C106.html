              A fragment of an extract of chü-chu-li or the fully annotated calendar, covering the 12th day of the 4th month to the 1st day of the 6th month of an unknown year. The 6th month is a short month (i.e. of 29 days) and corresponds to chi-wei and the 30th day of the 5th month to kêng-hsü. For remains of similar calendars see Giles, Descriptive Catalogue, nos. 7073-52; Wang (Chung-min), Tun-huang ku-chieh hsü-lu, Peking 1958, pp. 160-3, and his article in the Tung-fang tsa-chih, XXIV. 9, 1937.<br>

              Ch. 84. VI. 1 (530); foll. 15, 7 columns on each (fol. 1a, 13a, 15b blank): written by three hands or by the same scribe at different times.<br>
              A worn-out booklet of 15 leaves. Consists of five parts:<br>
              A. (1b) A poem of 28 characters.<br>
              B. (2a-5b) Pu-sa-wên or prayer read on the days of poṣadha or uposatha. These are several kinds of the days of poṣadha (cf. Taisho, LXXXV, pp. 1299-1300; Yabuki, Meisa Yoin Kaisetsu, Pt. 1, pp. 233-6; Mochizuki, Bukkyô Daijiten, etc.), and the prayer of this MS. was read on the 8th, 15th, and 30th of every month. It is quite different from those published in the Taisho, LXXXV, p. 1301.<br>
              C. (6a-11b) A catechism on the Hsiao-ch'êng san-k'o, which explains about the san-pao, ssŭ-ti, lu-kên, lu-ch'ên, lu-shih, shih-pa-chieh, and chiu-wu (ssŭ-tai and wu-yün). This portion is similar to the corresponding part of the Ta-ch'êng chung-tsung chien-chieh, C93.<br>
              D. (11b-12a) Ch'êng-chiu ta-wei-li pu-k'o-shuo-chin jo-yu-yü or Chin-kang-chou Vajra-Dhāraṇī which has a power, too great to be explained, to accomplish everything one wants.<br>
              E. (13b-15a) Tibetan text.<br>

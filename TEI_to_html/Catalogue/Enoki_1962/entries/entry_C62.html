              Ch. 0048, Kh. scroll; 240 c. x 31 c.: 138 columns.<br>
              The title is given at the beginning as the Ta-ch'êng wu-liang-shou ching and at the end as the Fo-shuo wu-liang-shou tsung-yao ching. The dhāraṇīs are numbered. This is the only complete copy of this sūtra in the Stein MSS. at the India Office Library. The sūtra itself is, however, one of the most popular at Tun-huang under such names as Wu-liang-shou tsung-yao ching or Fo-shuo wu-liang-shou tsung-yao ching. Cf. Yabuki, Meisa Yoin Kaisetsu, Pt. 2, pp. 139-55; Ishihama (Juntaro), Notes on MS. Remains found at Tun-huang, Tōyō Gakuhō, XV, 4 and XVI. 2, and Mochizuki, Bukkyō Daijiten, p. 3285b; Giles, Discriptive Catalogue, nos. 4856-5144. On the first column, the character chang is scrawled three times and the one character ch'ên under the title.<br>

            <span class="bibit">(A club circular)</span><br>
            
              Ch. 82 back; fragment of scroll; 23 c. x 25 c.: 6 columns, verso+1 recto.<br>
              Many MSS. of the same nature are found in the British Museum (Giles, Descriptive Catalogue, nos. 7572 ff.) and in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. The fragment is not dated and concerns a meeting for the memory of Liang Po-ming, a member of the club. The following titles and names are inscribed: Shê-[kuan] Li Hsiang, Shê-chang Yang An, Wang Chao, Ma Chia (Ku?), Tung Hun(?), Sung Yun, Chang Po-lin. For the clubs or unions of both secular people and Buddhist monks or nuns, which were established for the purpose of mutual aid or collaboration for religious matters, see Naba (Toshisada), Tōdai no Shayū ni tsukite, Shirin, XXIII (1923), pp. 223-65, 495-543, 729-93; id., Bukkyō shinkō ni motozukite soshikiseraretaru Chū-Bantō Jidai no Shayū ni tsukite, (1924), Shirin, XXIV, pp. 491-562, 743-93; Giles, B.S.O.S. IX, pp. 1025, 1038-40, X, p. 339, XI, pp. 156, 160.<br>
              The Tibetan, recto, is a memorandum about payments of barley and millet. The Chinese seems to be the last column of another club circular: only three characters are decipherable (a personal name?).<br>

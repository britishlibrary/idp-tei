              Stephen F. Teiser teaches history of religions at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/" target="_blank">Princeton
                                University</a>, where he is D.T. Suzuki Professor in Buddhist Studies
                                and Director of the <a href="http://eastasia.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Program

                                interaction between Buddhism and indigenous Chinese traditions,
                                brought into focus through the wealth of sūtras, non-canonical
                                texts, and artistic evidence unearthed on the Silk Road. An updated

              Stephen F. Teiser writes:<br>
              
                <a href="http://idp.bnf.fr/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Pelliot%20chinois%202583" target="_blank">Pelliot chinois 2583</a>is a scroll composed of thirteen
                                    sheets of paper originally written one at a time. Each sheet was
                                    a liturgy accompanying a single ritual act of donation on behalf
                                    of Dunhuang’s nuns, monks, and laypeople. Some of the rites were
                                    intended for healing sickness; others were documents used in
                                    memorial observances or the distribution of nuns’ clothing after
                                    death. Most of the prayers are short, occupying less than half a
                                    sheet. The detail of the page shown here (verso, sheet 4) opens
                                    by listing the type and amount of items offered: 'One piece of
                                    purple hanging silk (crossed out and corrected: cotton), one set
                                    consisting of official robe and silk skirt, one silk
                                    side-buttoning blouse.' The next two lines contain the liturgy
                                    proper, explaining that a nun named Mingqian has been sick,
                                    dedicating the donation’s merit to her cure, and asking that
                                    chanting accompany the rite. The fourth line records the donor’s
                                    name, the date, and a benediction. The last line seems to be the
                                    signature of the monastic official responsible for the
                                    disposition of the gift, a monk Huiyan.<br>
                Both sides of this
                                    fourteen-foot long scroll are fascinating. The side now labeled
                                    verso by the <a href="http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html" target="_blank">Bibliothèque nationale</a> was actually composed first,
                                    each sheet a written artifact of a ritual performance. The rites
                                    were undertaken on behalf of otherwise unknown local people
                                    during the period of Tibetan rule (786-848). The prayers provide
                                    refreshingly concrete, direct witness to the worries and hopes,
                                    the simple words and possessions of the performers. Later,
                                    someone collected all thirteen liturgies and pasted them
                                    end-to-end in scroll format, whose verso side (now labeled
                                    recto) was used for recording two more texts. The first, main
                                    text is a Chinese-language commentary authored by the most
                                    prolific bilingual monk at Dunhuang (Tibetan name: Gö Chödrup,
                                    Chinese name: Wu Facheng), on a Buddhist scripture on causality
                                    and the Four Noble Truths, <span class="bibit">The Rice Stalk
                                        Sūtra</span> (Skt.: <span class="bibit">Śālistambhaka-sūtra</span>). The second, shorter text on
                                    this side of the manuscript is a partial calendar for the year
                                    821, written upside-down and beginning from the end of the
                                    manuscript. For each day the almanac lists reigning deities;
                                    correlates for cycles of weather, sun, and moon; types of
                                    activities deemed lucky or unlucky; and so on.<br>
                The
                                    ensemble of the scroll’s two sides makes this my favorite
                                    manuscript in the Dunhuang collection. The texts offer
                                    elaborations of core Buddhist teachings plus hemerological
                                    calculation of lucky and unlucky days, all constructed on the
                                    back side of humble liturgies transferring merit to nuns, monks,
                                    and laypeople.<br>

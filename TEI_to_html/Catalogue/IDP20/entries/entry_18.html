              Daniel C. Waugh is Professor Emeritus at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu" target="_blank">University of
                                Washington</a> (Seattle, USA), where in the mid-1990s, his
                                interests shifted from his original specialization, pre-modern
                                Russia, to Central Asia. The watershed from which has flowed ‘the
                                rest of his life’ was his commitment in 1998 to start teaching a
                                course on the Silk Roads, in preparation for which he enrolled in a
                                summer program at the Mogao Caves, co-sponsored by the <a href="http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/toc/index.html" target="_blank">Silkroad
                                    Foundation</a> and the <a href="" target="_blank">Dunhuang Academy</a>. In subsequent years, he was the
                                founding director of <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad" target="_blank">Silk Road Seattle</a>, which sponsored a series of
                                educational programs and created an extensive set of Internet
                                resources. In 2003 he became editor of the <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/toc/newsletter.html" target="_blank">Silkroad
                                    Foundation’s journal</a>, which has now grown from a thin
                                newsletter to a substantial annual. Projects to develop and share
                                educational resources on the Silk Roads with the IDP are ongoing.
                                His chosen object is the Dunhuang silk banner <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=1919,0101,0.139" target="_blank">1919,0101,0.139</a>.<br>

                In 2009, I was in London examining
                                    the objects in the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org" target="_blank">British Museum</a> which had been donated by C. P. Skrine
                                    after he had served as British Consul General in Kashgar in the
                                    early 1920s. Skrine’s modest collection included fragments of
                                    early Buddhist paintings and manuscripts which he had acquired
                                    in Khotan. The article I co-authored with Ursula Sims-Williams
                                    on the Skrine material and the antiquities market in Khotan then
                                    appeared in my journal <a href="http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/vol8/srjournal_v8.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="bibit">The Silk Road</span>, Vol.
                                    8</a>(PDF), and has since been published in Chinese
                                    translation.<br>
                On that trip to London, I was fortunate to be
                                    included in a private viewing of some of the Dunhuang banners,
                                    which Roderick Whitfield had organized for a colleague. When
                                    asked there in the storage rooms of the British Museum whether
                                    there were any of the banners from Mogao Cave 17 that I
                                    particularly wanted to see, with little hesitation I chose <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=1919,0101,0.139" target="_blank">1919,0101,0.139</a>, a late ninth-century painting on
                                    silk depicting a bodhisattva holding a glass bowl. Why that
                                    painting? In the first instance for the bowl, which to my mind
                                    embodies much of what the ‘Silk Roads’ are all about. It is one
                                    of the Middle Eastern cut glass bowls (numerous in the Sassanian
                                    period) which traveled along the Silk Roads all the way to Japan
                                    where one is in the collection of the Shōsō-in at Nara. When
                                    found in archaeological contexts these bowls usually have a
                                    rough patina and no longer are transparent, but here one can see
                                    through the bowl the hand that is holding it. In a recent
                                    addition to its display of such Sassanian glass, the British
                                    Museum has included a replica (2007.6004.1) made by Japanese
                                    glass artist Tami Ishida to give a sense of how their facets
                                    would have sparkled when new.<br>
                That Dunhuang banner also
                                    evokes memories for me. When at the Mogao Caves for the first
                                    time in 1998, I was particularly struck by Cave 196, dated to
                                    893–4, that is, approximately the same time as the banner. Cave
                                    196 is distinctive in that, unlike most of the other Mogao
                                    caves, it has preserved its original entrance hall and also some
                                    of its statues in their original position on the large U-shaped
                                    altar platform of the main hall. The best known of these is a
                                    bodhisattva of great beauty in the position of 'royal ease',
                                    whose features remind us of the bodhisattva depicted on the
                                    banner.<br>
                Cave 196 is an early example of the the design of
                                    some of the largest and most impressive of the Mogao caves, best
                                    known from the ones commissioned by the Cao family in the tenth
                                    century. Among them is Cave 61, constructed about half a century
                                    after Cave 196, which contains the famous depiction of Mt. Wutai
                                    on the west wall and the numerous donor images of the Cao family
                                    in the lower register at the east side of the room. The
                                    imposing, larger-than-life statuary, which would have occupied
                                    the central altar platform in those caves, is no longer extant.
                                    Cave 196 thus offers a rare sense of what the devotee of the
                                    ninth or tenth century might actually have experienced upon
                                    entering such a cave, as though re-born in Paradise in the
                                    actual presence of the Buddhist divinities. The devotee of my
                                    imagination might well have earned merit by commissioning a
                                    banner whose elaborately garbed subject bears what would have
                                    been considered a most precious offering.<br>
                When we
                                    contemplate Dunhuang, our gaze tends to be directed inward, to
                                    the treasure trove of manuscripts, banners, murals and statuary
                                    which have so transformed our understanding of the Silk Roads.
                                    It is easy to get lost in the details. For many over the
                                    centuries down to the present, to visit the Mogao Caves has been
                                    a life-changing experience, with some of the most vivid memories
                                    the result of turning the gaze outwards. Remember that the
                                    founding of the caves is associated with a vision experienced at
                                    sunrise over the Sanwei Mountain to the east: Mogao is special
                                    not in the least for its extraordinary natural setting. Too few
                                    visitors today climb the hills to see the fragile strip of green
                                    below in its starkly beautiful desert setting and experience the
                                    landscape turning purple at sunset. Even fewer would spend a
                                    night (as I did in 1998) at the temple on the top of Sanwei
                                    Mountain with its curious ‘folk’ image of Guanyin, watching the
                                    moon rise and awakening next morning to a rosy-fingered
                                    dawn.<br>

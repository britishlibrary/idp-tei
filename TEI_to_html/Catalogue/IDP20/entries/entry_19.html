              John Falconer is Lead Curator of Visual Arts at the <a href="www.bl.uk/" target="_blank">British
                                Library</a>. This includes the Library's photographic collections, which
                                are particularly strong on historical collections of India, his
                                specialism. However, he has also been working on the Stein and other
                                Central Asian photographic collections for over twenty years, having
                                catalogued those at the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/" target="_blank">British Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.mtak.hu/index_en.php" target="_blank">Library and
                                Information Centre of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences</a>. He has also
                                travelled and worked in the field, including on IDP Field Trips to
                                the Taklamakan: many of his own photographs are now in the Library's
                                collections and were on display at the <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/events/RGS2014/intro.html" target="_blank">IDP20
                                    photographic exhibition</a> at the <a href="http://www.rgs.org/HomePage.htm" target="_blank">Royal Geographical Society</a>.
                                He has also curated photographic exhibitions in Afghanistan, Sri
                                Lanka, Myamar, China and elsewhere. His chosen item is a photograph
                                taken by Robert Byron.<br>

              John Falconer writes:<br>
              
                In the decade before his untimely death in the early days of the
                                    Second World War, Robert Byron (1905–41) established an enduring
                                    reputation as an art and architectural historian. His travels
                                    through Iran and Afghanistan in search of the purest examples of
                                    Islamic architecture in the early 1930s are described in his
                                    best-known work, <span class="bibit">The Road to
                                    Oxiana</span> (1937). While frequently displaying the casual
                                    racism and snobbery common to so many upper-middle class
                                    Englishmen of his generation, the book remains a perceptive and
                                    often hilarious account of a difficult and sometime dangerous
                                    journey. Despite radically personal and often idiosyncratic
                                    opinions on architecture — he notes approvingly of the
                                    Gumbad-i-Alaviyan at Hamadan that it 'wipes the taste of the
                                        Alhambra and the Taj Mahal out of one’s mouth … I came to
                                        Persia to get rid of that taste' — he was a passionate
                                    devotee of the arts of Central Asia.<br>
                His extensive
                                    collection of photographs (British Library shelfmark: Neg 1240)
                                    is among the most enduring and valuable of his legacies,
                                    providing a unique record of the buildings encountered and
                                    described on his travels, many of them now inaccessible, altered
                                    or entirely destroyed. The image selected here is rare in
                                    including a human presence: in contrast to his prose, Byron was
                                    not significantly concerned in his photographs with evoking
                                    atmosphere or creating artistic images. His purpose was to
                                    provide an accurate visual record for his own writings and for
                                    future historians of architectural form. In his wanderings
                                    around the monuments of Herat, a city that has seen massive
                                    damage to its historic fabric in recent decades, he writes of
                                    feeling as one 'who has lighted on the lost books of Livy, or
                                        an unknown Botticelli'. His photographs preserve, however
                                    inadequately, something of this heritage.<br>
                Coincidentally,
                                    the Byron collection forms a further link with another important
                                    archive of photographs in the British Library. Byron nursed an
                                    unrequited passion for the traveller and writer Desmond Parsons
                                    until the latter’s death in 1937, and had lived with him in
                                    Peking in 1934. Parsons’ own photographs recording his visit to
                                    the Dunhuang Caves in 1935 (BL shelfmark: Photo 1275), were
                                    recently presented to the British Library and are also available
                                    for study on the <a href="http://idp.bl.uk" target="_blank">IDP

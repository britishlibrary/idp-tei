              John Cayley
            <br>
            
              John Cayley — now teaching at <a href="http://www.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Brown University</a> in the guise of a
                                pioneering practitioner and theorist of digital language arts — was
                                once, in the late 1980s, a curator in the Chinese Section of
                                    the <a href="http://www.bl.uk" target="_blank">British Library</a>. There,
                                he had experience with research relating to items in the Dunhuang
                                collection and, moreover, had the high privilege, occasionally, of
                                examining some of this material firsthand. Chinese calligraphy
                                remains a research interest for Cayley. The calligraphy of the major
                                part of the Dunhuang collection is a wonder of calligraphic art on a
                                global scale, but this ‘major part’ chiefly represents the art of
                                the religiously motivated scribe rather than that of the
                                scholar-artist, the Chinese person (usually man) of letters.
                                Nonetheless, the collection—as we will see from the item Cayley has
                                sponsored and which is also one of his very ‘favourite things’ —
                                does contain uniquely precious evidence for the high art of
                                calligraphy, China’s finest visual art, still its most dearly and
                                commercially valued traditional art form.<br>
              Besides aspiring,
                                some day, to a significant connoisseurship of Chinese calligraphy,
                                John Cayley is also a poet and a translator of poetry and has been
                                small publisher of these complementary language arts. He has
                                published translations from Gu Cheng, Yang Lian, Bing Xin, and
                                others, and assembled a book-length study of the well-known
                                contemporary artist Xu Bing. Links to his experimental writing in
                                what he calls networked and programmable media are at <a href="http://programmatology.shadoof.net" target="_blank">programmatology.shadoof.net</a>. Recent and ongoing projects
                                    include <span class="bibit">imposition</span>, <span class="bibit">riverIsland</span>, <span class="bibit">what we will</span>,
                                    and <a href="http://thereadersproject.org" target="_blank"><span class="bibit">The Readers Project</span></a>. His last printed book
                                of poems, adaptations and translations was <span class="bibit">Ink
                                    Bamboo</span> (Agenda &amp; Belew, 1996).<br>
              In 2001 Cayley
                                was the winner of the Electronic Literature Organization’s Award for
                                Poetry (<a href="http://eliterature.org" target="_blank">eliterature.org</a>).
                                Currently he is a Professor in the <a href="https://brown.edu/academics/literary-arts/" target="_blank">Department of
                                    Literary Arts at Brown University</a>, with a brief to teach
                                and develop writing in digital media. His most recent work explores
                                ambient poetics in programmable media, writing in immersive
                                artificial audiovisual environments, and aestheticized vectors of
                                reading. He also publishes theory about these new modes of writing,
                                essays on subjects such as the role of code in new writing, the
                                temporal properties of text, and something he calls ‘writing to be
                                found’ both with and against the ‘services’ that threaten us with
                                overwhelming statistical models of language.<br>

                                    relative small fragment of distinctively tinted, ‘fancy’, paper
                                    with traces of cursive characters. These traces would be
                                    immediately recognisable to any student of Chinese calligraphy
                                    and likely also to anyone more generally educated in the Chinese
                                    cultural sphere, extending beyond the mainland, throughout East
                                    Asia and now, the globe. This vastly more numerous group would
                                    not only see that the calligraphy was good, they would be likely
                                    to know the name of the artist who wrote these characters and is
                                    responsible for their aesthetic form, Wang Xizhi (303–361),
                                    China’s most famous calligrapher. Strangely, in terms of a
                                    Eurocentric understanding of high art, nearly all of these
                                    amateurs of calligraphy would also know, without having to be
                                    told, that these traces of ink on the paper of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.3753" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.3753</a> were not actually put there by Wang
                                    Xizhi. The true students of calligraphy amongst them would be
                                    aware that the current state of scholarship suggests to us that
                                    there are no actual traces of Wang Xizhi’s brushwork extant. As
                                    the eminent art historian, Robert E. Harrist, puts it in the
                                    title of a highly relevant article, we have nothing but ‘copies,
                                    all the way down.’ How then do we understand the significance
                                    and value of this treasure? We say that <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.3753" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.3753</a> is a fragment of a <span class="bibit">fatie</span> or ‘model (of) calligraphy’. We can say further
                                    that the art of Chinese calligraphy is a complex practice that
                                    has embraced many forms of what, from a Eurocentric perspective,
                                    we would regard — and tend to denigrate — as ‘copying’.<br>
                In the
                                    Chinese cultural sphere, these practices of ‘copying’ are
                                    understood as authentic and generative, and many of them are
                                    able to preserve, more or less intact, the aesthetic and
                                    cultural value of fine artistic works. In all their
                                    instantiations and despite their variously mediated
                                    transmission, such works of aesthetic writing may be
                                    definitively associated with a first author, with a single,
                                    named and often famous calligrapher. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.3753" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.3753</a> is a freehand copy (Chinese: <span class="bibit">lin</span>) and is dated, by its inclusion in
                                    the Dunhuang collection, to the Tang dynasty. The personal notes
                                    and courtesy letters written by Wang Xizhi were preserved and
                                    copied due to the beauty of his writing. Once his calligraphy
                                    had achieved the status of fine art treasure — within his
                                    lifetime — rare originals and more widely disseminated copies
                                    immediately became models for all calligraphy students and
                                    remain so right down to the present day. <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.3753" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.3753</a> is a remarkably early copy of one of
                                    these models. The most prized collected copies of Wang Xizhi’s
                                    writing (such as <span class="bibit">Xingrang
                                        tie</span> or <span class="bibit">Ritual to Pray for Good
                                        Harvest</span> in the John B. Elliott Collection) are
                                    tracing copies, although these tracing copies done, probably
                                    under imperial patronage, with a finesse that somehow preserves
                                    even the spontaneity of the first artist’s cursive
                                    gestures.<br>
                Successful copies of all kinds may capture the <span class="bibit">shenyun</span> or ‘spirit resonance’ of Wang’s
                                    writing. Whenever performed by a calligraphic master, a freehand
                                    copy—most often written with some earlier ‘model’ or <span class="bibit">fatie</span> at the calligrapher’s side — may
                                    capture the <span class="bibit">shenyun</span> of the first writer and
                                    become itself a model. For <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.3753" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.3753</a>, we have no indication of its
                                    contemporary calligrapher’s name, but we can see for ourselves
                                    that the characters are good and the early date of this copy
                                    renders it all but uniquely precious. There is another fragment,
                                    in the Pelliot collection in Paris (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Pelliot%20chinois%204642" target="_blank">Pelliot chinois 4642</a>), likely from the same set of
                                    model copies and based on the same series of Wang Xizhi models,
                                        the <span class="bibit">Shiqi tie</span> or ’<span class="bibit">17 model
                                    calligraphies</span>.’ The majority of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.3753" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.3753</a> comprises the lower remains of a brief
                                    eight-line note known to calligraphers and connoisseurs as
                                        the <span class="bibit">Zhanjin tie</span>.<br>
                For
                                    still wider dissemination, model calligraphy might be traced and
                                    transferred onto the surface of prepared tablets or monumental
                                    stones. The character forms, no matter how cursive and gestural,
                                    were then carefully carved in intaglio. Finally, models could be
                                    ‘published’ from these inscriptions by making ink rubbings on
                                    sheets of paper tamped into the carved incisions — a slow process,
                                    but one that allowed for multiple ‘prints’ to be reproduced from
                                    the same model. Rubbings from the earliest carved inscriptions —
                                    think of all the mediating steps in this complex tradition of
                                    reproduction! — might themselves come to be esteemed for their
                                    preservation of a calligrapher’s writing and its <span class="bibit">shenyun</span>. If the stones were later lost
                                    or destroyed, a rubbing might be all that was left. There are,
                                    in fact, a few treasured early rubbings in the Dunhuang
                                    collection, including <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.5791" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.5791</a> with the calligraphy of Ouyang Xun
                                    (557-641). Some time ago, as an experiment, I took a digital
                                    image of the main part of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.3753" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.3753</a>, and overlaid it on a scan from the
                                    publication of a much later rubbing based on the ‘same’ work.
                                    The white character forms of the rubbing are still, in
                                    principle, traceable back to the initial brush strokes of Wang
                                    Xizhi, but there can have been no direct connection — other than
                                    through artistry and <span class="bibit">shenyun</span> — with <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.3753" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.3753</a>’s anonymous freehand traces of ink on
                                    Tang dynasty paper. The way in which the two images align is not
                                    perfect but it is extraordinarily close — perceptible evidence, in
                                    a sense, of the preservation of <span class="bibit">shenyun</span> across centuries and despite many and various
                                    processes of transmission by generative reproduction.<br>
                How
                                    valuable to wealthy collectors over time? In his essay 'The Cost
                                    of Living and the Cost of Art in Late Ming China’, Craig Clunas
                                    quotes a Chinese source giving evidence that some version —
                                    necessarily a reproduction — of this very piece of calligraphy,
                                        the <span class="bibit">Zhanjin tie</span>, changed hands
                                    in the late Ming for almost twice what it would cost to buy the
                                    equivalent of a Park Avenue or Mayfair mansion. In 2010, four
                                    lines of Wang Xizhi’s calligraphy — probably Tang tracing copies
                                    — sold at auction for £29m. A fragment of silk with nine lines
                                    on it had been torn in half and the first four lines were

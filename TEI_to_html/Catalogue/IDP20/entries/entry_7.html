              Hans van Roon
            <br>
            
              Hans van Roon is a Dutch chartered accountant and financial
                                specialist who in 1987 read Peter Hopkirk’s <span class="bibit">Foreign
                                    Devils on the Silk Road</span> and never stopped reading again.
                                This was the beginning of his own personal Silk Road journey. He
                                publishes on a regularly basis the latest news about the Silk Road
                                and anything related to IDP on his blog <a href="http://mongolschinaandthesilkroad.blogspot.nl" target="_blank">Mongols
                                    China and the Silk Road</a>.<br>
              His favourite object is
                                the third of five nearly complete Sogdian letters from the beginning
                                of the fourth century, discovered in 1907 by Aurel Stein some 90 km
                                west of Dunhuang.<br>
            <br>
            
              Hans van Roon writes:<br>
              Many readers will be familiar with this letter but this one is
                                special to me as:<p>• This was found by Aurel Stein;<br>• These letters are the most ancient monuments of the Sogdian
                                        language;<br>• This one is almost complete and full of drama with an
                                        abandoned wife in the middle of nowhere while, we as readers
                                        know her cry for help never arrived at its destination;<br>• It is written by a woman and the length of the letter
                                        suggests that it is not her first and only letter. It ends
                                        with the famous bitter words of anger to her husband: ‘I
                                        would rather be a dog’s or a pig’s wife than yours!’<br>• It makes you feel that you are in direct contact with someone
                                        from the fourth century, which is something magical!<br></p><br>

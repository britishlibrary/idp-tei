            <br>
            
              Fan Jinshi is Director of the <a href="http://www.dha.ac.cn" target="_blank">Dunhuang Academy</a> in China. Her research interests are on
                                Chinese Central Asia — known historically in China as ‘The Western
                                Regions’. This is part of the ancient ‘Silk Road’ where trade and
                                culture flourished and where diverse civilisations met. In the rich
                                cultural legacy that remains in the region we can glimpse the
                                history of a thousand years of interaction between these
                                civilisations. Buddhism had a far-reaching impact in its journey
                                from India through Central Asia to China and East Asia. The Dunhuang
                                Mogao caves are a direct result of this, showcasing this mix of
                                cultures. Having been involved for many years with research on and
                                protection of the caves, Professor Fan Jinshi has a strong interest
                                in the cultural connections between Dunhuang and Central
                                Asia.<br>
              Her chosen item is the painting <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=1919,0101,0.6" target="_blank">1919,0101,0.6</a>.<br>

                The painting has several
                                    interesting features. Firstly, the heads of the three younger
                                    disciples are very round with round faces and cute expressions.
                                    Second, the painting is very similar to murals found in Dunhuang
                                    Mogao Caves dating from the early Tang period. For example, the
                                        complex <span class="bibit">lingzhi</span> mushroom (<span class="bibit">灵芝</span>) design depicted on the canopy and the lotus seat
                                    is identical to that shown in the preaching scene on the east
                                    wall of Mogao Cave 329, dating to the early Tang. Third, the
                                    composition is very similar to the Pure Land and preaching
                                    scenes depicted in early Tang caves such as Mogao 321 and 329.
                                    This type of composition is thought to have originated from the
                                    preaching scene in the Sui-period Mogao Cave 390. These
                                    similarities indicate a close relationship between this piece
                                    and the murals of the same period at Dunhuang Mogao.<br>

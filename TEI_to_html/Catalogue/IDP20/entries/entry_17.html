                The manuscript of the ‘Library Document’ (<a href="http://idp.orientalstudies.ru/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=F-32/4" target="_blank">F-32/4</a>) was discovered by the Second Russian
                                    Turkestan Expedition headed by Sergey Oldenburg in Dunhuang and
                                    became part of the collection of The Asiatic Museum (now
                                        The <a href="http://www.orientalstudies.ru/eng/" target="_blank">Institute
                                        of Oriental Manuscripts</a>, RAS) with all the other documents on September 1, 1915. The separate sheet of white
                                    paper (30 x 17.2 cm) was registered as a ‘Postscript to <span class="bibit">Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra</span>’.<br>
                The text states that the ruler of
                                    Dunhuang Cao Zongshou and his wife Lady Fan issued an order to
                                    make cloth wrappers for Buddhist sutras and to supplement the
                                    lacunae in the library of Baoen Monastery. The document was
                                    dated the 15th day under the sign <span class="bibit">renyin</span> of the 7th month of the
                                    5th year under the reign of Universal Peace (<span class="bibit">Xianping</span>) of the
                                    Song Dynasty, which corresponds to August 25, 1002. This 4-line
                                    document therewith became one of the pearls of Russian
                                    collection, for the clear reason that there are not too many
                                    documents from the Library Cave bearing a full date. And it is
                                    remarkable and even unique, as it represents a long forgotten
                                    type of document that reflects the daily life of Chinese
                                    society in a provincial town located close to the state’s
                                    frontier.<br>
                Moroever, in the course of the research and
                                    print and on-line publication of the Dunhuang collections from
                                    all over the world no other document with a full date from later
                                    than this has come to light, even if there is circumstantial
                                    evidence that such documents may exist. So then, this
                                    unpretentious short manuscript <a href="http://idp.orientalstudies.ru/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=F-32/4" target="_blank">F-32/4</a> retains its complete timeless
                            value.<br>

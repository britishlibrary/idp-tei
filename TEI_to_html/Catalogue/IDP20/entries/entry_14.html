              After studying Old and Middle Iranian languages and related
                            subjects at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Cambridge</a>, Nicholas Sims-Williams has spent his whole
                                career at the <a href="http://www.soas.ac.uk" target="_blank">School of Oriental
                                    and African Studies</a>, University of London, where his
                                teaching has covered seven Iranian languages (Avestan, Old Persian,
                                Middle Persian, Parthian, Choresmian, Bactrian, Sogdian and
                                Khotanese) and occasionally Syriac. Although he has published on all
                                of these languages, he has concentrated on the Middle Iranian
                                languages of Eastern Iran and Central Asia, in particular Sogdian
                                and Bactrian. He is equally interested in the languages themselves,
                                with their Indo-European roots, and in their Central Asian setting,
                                with its stimulating mixture of languages, cultures and religions.
                                In addition to a two-volume edition of Sogdian inscriptions from
                                Northern Pakistan and a three-volume edition of Bactrian documents
                                from Northern Afghanistan, his books include studies of many
                                manuscripts in the IDP, such as documents in mixed Sogdian and Old
                                Turkish from the London and Paris collections and Christian Sogdian
                                and New Persian manuscripts in the Berlin Turfan
                                collection.<br>
              His chosen item is Sogdian Letter No. 2 <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8212/95" target="_blank">Or.8212/95</a>, Stein site id. T.XII.a.ii.2.<br>

              Nicholas Sims-Williams writes:<br>
              
                In 1907 Aurel Stein
                                    discovered a cache of early paper documents at the site T.XII.a
                                    to the west of Dunhuang, a guard-post on the wall protecting the
                                    western border of China. These are known as the ‘Ancient
                                    Letters’ because they are among the earliest documents written
                                    in Sogdian, a language of the Iranian family formerly spoken in
                                    Sogdiana, the region around Samarkand in present-day Uzbekistan,
                                    and in the numerous trading colonies established by the Sogdians
                                    along the route to central China. The Ancient Letters represent
                                    the contents of a postbag lost in transit from China to the
                                    west, perhaps confiscated by the Chinese authorities. Written by
                                    Sogdians in Xinjiang and Gansu and addressed to their
                                    compatriots in Sogdiana or Loulan, the letters provide a unique
                                    glimpse into the lives of the Sogdian merchants on the so-called
                                    ‘Silk Road’.<br>
                Several of these letters could easily have
                                    qualified as my favourite item — no. 6 (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8212/97" target="_blank">Or.8212/97</a>), the only one which actually mentions
                                    silk, or nos. 1 (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8212/92.1" target="_blank">Or.8212/92.1</a>) and 3 (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8212/98" target="_blank">Or.8212/98</a>), two letters written by a woman
                                    abandoned in Dunhuang by her husband — but I have finally
                                        chosen Letter no. 2 (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8212/95" target="_blank">Or.8212/95</a>). This letter was written
                                    by Nanai-vandak, a Sogdian agent stationed somewhere in Gansu,
                                    possibly in Jincheng, and addressed to his partners in
                                    Samarkand, the capital of Sogdiana, over 2,000 miles to the
                                    west. Perhaps because of the distance it had to travel, it was
                                    protected by an inner wrapper of brown silk and an outer
                                    envelope of coarse fabric which bears instructions for the
                                    delivery of the letter. The letter, which was probably written
                                    in June or July 313 AD contains news of momentous events in
                                    China: a severe famine in the capital Luoyang; fighting between
                                    the Huns (Xiongnu) and the Chinese; the flight of the emperor;
                                    and the sack of the cities of Ye (in 307) and Luoyang (in
                                    311).<br>
                While the main importance of this letter lies in the
                                    historical data it contains, what I find particularly affecting
                                    are the paragraphs with which it ends, a poignant last will and
                                    testament. Nanai-vandak regards the events described as bringing
                                    to an end the world as he knows it and foresees nothing but ruin
                                    and death for himself and the other Sogdian merchants in China.
                                    Since he does not expect to return home, he asks his
                                    correspondents in Samarkand to look after a large sum of money
                                    which he had left on deposit there, to invest it on behalf of
                                    the orphan Takhsich-vandak, presumably his son, who is still a
                                    minor, and to find him a wife when he comes of age. But of
                                    course his letter never reached its destination, so it is
                                    unlikely that its provisions were ever carried out. We can only
                                    speculate as to what became of the father and his son: did
                                    Nanai-vandak survive and return home? and did his partners find
                                    a wife for Takhsich-vandak and hand over his
                                inheritance?<br>

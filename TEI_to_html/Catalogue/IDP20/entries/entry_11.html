              Helen’s interests in Central Asia focus in particular
                                on the exchange in textiles; in motifs and technologies during the
                                first millenium and how the textiles can help us understand the
                                societies where they were made and used. Her interests also include
                                fashion and identity. She has lectured and published extensively on
                                textiles from the Silk Road, among others <span class="bibit">Textiles

                Well, I do like shoes and this peculiar
                                    looking and old shoe is very special. Although the shoe's
                                    original functions were practical and protective, there is a
                                    clear design element to it. The utilitarian everyday object has
                                    decorative features as well, showing human's desire to embellish
                                    even the simplest of artefacts. The shoe was discovered in a
                                    refuse heap, discarded most likely because of worn holes in the
                                    heel and the ball of the toes. The upper is made of two or more
                                    thicknesses of strong plain woven hemp or cotton, bound together
                                    by even rows of hemp string, producing a pattern of dots all
                                    over. The process of sewing two or more layers of materials
                                    together to make thicker padded material is like quilting and
                                    just as in quilting, the stitching has become both functional
                                    and decorative. A drawstring is threaded around the upper edge,
                                    which by a clever method of crossing near the instep restricts
                                    the size of the opening and draws up the slack of the fabric
                                    over the toes into a sort of point. This has created a curious
                                    profile of the shoe, like a horn. The thick sole has warp of
                                    hemp cord placed lengthways with weft of string plaited in a
                                    ‘wrapped-twined’ manner. Furthermore, the entire sole is covered
                                    with tight knots of string, which would have the effect of the
                                    hob-nailed military sandals of the Romans or the climbing nails
                                    in a modern boot. The knots would have made walking on the sand
                                    in the Taklamakan Desert much easier. This type of sole can also
                                    be seen in the footwear of the terracotta soldiers from Xi’an,
                                    showing that this sort of footwear is not a single occurrence
                                    but most likely had a long tradition. It would most likely have
                                    been worn as an outer shoe, i.e. over a thinner cloth
                                    shoe.<br>
                This shoe was recovered from the site known as the
                                    Limes Watchtowers, which actually include several different
                                    sites of fortified encampments north of Dunhuang in northwest
                                    China, along the edges of the Taklamakan Desert. They were
                                    designed to ensure the safe transit of goods across the area and
                                    served as a base for expansion into Central Asia. Within the
                                    towers Stein found an astounding range of artefacts, which
                                    provide a glimpse of garrison life and military operations under
                                    the Han empire, including bronze mirrors, coarse pottery, tools,
                                    leather armour, weapons, shoes, and clothing. Ancient documents
                                    included personal letters on silk and wood; military directives
                                    and supply lists; and treatises on a range of subjects,
                                    including medicine and astrology. This shoe was found at the
                                    garrison station named by Stein as T.VI.b, where many Chinese
                                    documents dating from 68–56 BCE were found — indicating that
                                    this artefact is among the oldest shoes in the V&amp;A
                                    collection.<br>
                This shoe is one of my favourite Stein
                                    objects, as it is an everyday object which basic form is
                                    functional, but been created with ingenuity and some decorative
                                    elements. It contributes to the story of Central Asian life
                                    during the Han dynasty.<br>

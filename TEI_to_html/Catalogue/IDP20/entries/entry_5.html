                <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Or.8210/S.6168" target="_blank">Or.8210/S.6168</a>is the earliest illustration of
                                    moxibustion practice, the therapeutic treatment that uses
                                    artemesia punk and other cautery techniques to treat illnesses.
                                    It pre-dates the earliest Chinese bronze acupuncture models used
                                    for teaching in the Song period by at least a century and
                                    represents a pervasive medical culture in evidence at both the
                                    centre and periphery of Chinese administration. I have called
                                    this culture 'quick and easy Chinese medicine', because the
                                    charts provide everything you need to know: the locations of the
                                    points, symptoms of the illnesses, numbers of cautery to place
                                    and burn on the points with little reference to the kind of
                                    theory that requires a classical education. It is therefore a
                                    'householder' treatment for everyday symptoms. It can be
                                    compared and contrasted to Tibetan manuscripts in the Pelliot
                                    collection which reveal the cross-cultural transmission of
                                    medicine in the Dunhuang area.<br>
                I love this mansuscript and
                                    sponsored it in the name of my late father, Kenneth Lo. When I
                                    first began researching medicine in early and medieval
                                    manuscript cultures I had no idea there was such a treasure just
                                    down the road from my office. Both in my work as an
                                    acupuncturist and as an historian I have been intrigued by what
                                    makes an acceptable home treatment and what is properly in the
                                    domain of the professional. In the history of Chinese therapy
                                    moxibustion has been much more prevalent than acupuncture.
                                    Artemesia grows everywhere and is easy to prepare into moxa.
                                    Even though in the Chinese context historically, and in some
                                    places still today, the moxa is applied until the skin blisters
                                    so there is a danger of infection, in most parts of the world it
                                    has become a much gentler practice and, in my view, is safe to
                                    use at home with very little instruction.<br>

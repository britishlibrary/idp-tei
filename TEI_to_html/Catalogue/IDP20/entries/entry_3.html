              Tsuguhito Takeuchi writes:<br>
              
                This is a particular type of tally stick. One side is painted
                                    red with several short and long notches cut into it. A wedge is
                                    cut away at the bottom right. On the left side is written a
                                    place name, ending with <span class="bibit">rtse</span> ‘mountain peak.’ This is a
                                    place for <span class="bibit">ri-zug</span> or hill-stationing of watchmen, a unit of
                                    four men, consisting of Tibetan soldiers and Khotanese cooks.
                                    They were sent from the Mazār Tāgh fort to hill stations in the
                                    desert. When they set out, they brought the cut-out wedge as a
                                    tally to receive provisions (barley) later from a courier who
                                    carried this master woodslip bearing the name of the
                                    hill-station. At the time of receiving provisions, both short
                                    and long notched served for identification: the short notches
                                    represented the amount of grain, while the long ones served for
                                    matching-up.<br>
                Although each <span class="bibit">ri-zug</span> slip appears to
                                    contain scarce information, closer examinations reveal how they
                                    actually functioned. They attest the sophisticated logistic
                                    system of the Tibetan military administration, a key for
                                    understanding how a small number of Tibetans controlled the vast
                                    colonial empire.<br>
                These slips together with paper documents
                                    also vividly indicate the harshness of the lives of local
                                    peoples. How were they recruited and sent to stations? They tell
                                    of the escape and execution of Khotanese, etc. Seemingly humble
                                    finds yield much information!<br>

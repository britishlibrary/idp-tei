              One of my favourite items in the Berlin Turfan Collection is the
                                    bifolio <a href="http://idp.bbaw.de/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=M%204a" target="_blank">M
                                    4a</a> and in particular the right-hand side on which a small
                                hymn is preserved entirely. The bifolio is an exquisite example of
                                Manichaean book art. The scribe used an elaborate headline and
                                initial letter extending into the upper right margin to create a
                                very pleasing design. The short text is framed within rubrics in red
                                that identify its beginning and end. It is in Parthian, a language
                                from the north of Iran which probably died out in the seventh
                                century but which has survived because it was still used by
                                Manichaeans in far-away Turfan on the Silk Road in the tenth
                                century.<br>

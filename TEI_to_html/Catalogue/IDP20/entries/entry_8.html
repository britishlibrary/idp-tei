              Helen Wang writes:<br>
              
                I’ve chosen Miss Lorimer (Stein’s
                                    Recording Angel, or R.A.) in recognition of her outstanding
                                    commitment and contribution to Sir Aurel Stein’s projects and
                                    undertakings. Miss Lorimer worked with Stein for thirteen years,
                                    spending nine years at the British Museum, and four years in
                                    India. Although Stein was an exceptionally competent keeper of
                                    records and accounts (if in doubt, take a look at his <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/16_Diamond-Rogers-Fletcher.pdf" target="_blank">papers in the Bodleian Library</a>), it’s quite clear
                                    that he preferred the open air to the office. After all, how
                                    many ‘Education Officers’ are able to spend months on
                                    expeditions away from their desks? And how many archaeologists
                                    of no fixed abode are able to keep such close tabs on their
                                    recording team?<br>
                When the shipments arrived in London, it
                                    was the small team of Mr Andrews and Miss Lorimer who set to
                                    work on the collection. Stein joined them when he could. At the
                                    British Museum, the Stein Collection had its own space, with its
                                    own lock and key, and it was here that Andrews and Lorimer
                                    unpacked the finds, stored them safely, and created the slips.
                                    These were long strips of paper, once used like index cards in
                                    the museum, and now superseded by spreadsheets and databases.
                                    Each object had its own slip, which typically recorded the
                                    object’s ‘Stein number’ (his unique system, combining upper and
                                    lower case letters, and Roman and Arabic numerals to indicate
                                    the precise context of a site find, purchase or gift), its
                                    measurements and a description. The slips served as the basis
                                    for the thousands of object descriptions published in Stein’s
                                    publications, and they were essential for managing the
                                    collection. Some parts of the collection travelled, and Miss
                                    Lorimer, in particular, had to keep track of everything. For
                                    example, in 1911 over 400 Chinese manuscripts were <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/12_Wood%20(Tentative%20listiing).pdf" target="_blank">sent to Paul Pelliot in Paris</a>for cataloguing, and
                                    remained there throughout the First World War.<br>
                The Stein
                                    Collections are phenomenally important — for the wonderful
                                    objects and manuscripts, of course, but also for the meticulous
                                    recording of the contexts in which they were found. This does
                                    not happen by itself. Without the painstaking efforts of people
                                    like Miss Lorimer, who mostly work behind the scenes and are
                                    seldom acknowledged, our understanding of the Silk Road would be
                                    so much the poorer.<br>

            <br>
            
              Agnes Kelecsényi and Kinga Dévényi are curators in the Oriental
                            Collection of the <a href="http://www.mtak.hu/index.php" target="_blank">Library and Information Centre of the Hungarian
                                Academy of Sciences</a> in Budapest, where Stein’s bequest is preserved.
                                They have been strongly involved in disseminating knowledge about
                                this collection including various digitisation and cataloguing
                                projects with IDP. Their chosen item is Aurel Stein's manuscript of
                                    the <span class="bibit">Sand-buried Ruins of
                            Khotan</span>.<br>

              Agnes Kelecsényi and Kinga Dévényi write:<br>
              
                The two volume manuscript, bound in brown leather, consists of
                                    two parts: The text of the Preliminary Note in Stein’s
                                    pagination Vol.1.:434 ff. and Vol. 2.: 435-812 ff. completed in
                                    London, 6 February 1903. At the end of the manuscript two parts
                                    are inserted from his diary written during his return journey to
                                    Europe: Osh, 8 June 1901 (13 ff.); and Samarkand, 15 June 1901
                                    (6 ff.).<br>
                This manuscript was donated to the Hungarian
                                    Academy of Sciences by Stein as a part of his first donation of
                                    books to the Academy of his native land.<br>
                It is our
                                    favourite item because his neat handwriting and scarce
                                    amendments reflect his scholarly way of composing and his well
                                    disciplined character. While the dried flowers put among the
                                    leaves of the manuscript, and which are from the Mohand Marg,
                                    his mountain retreat in Kashmir, are a sign of his tender heart,
                                    love of nature, and spirituality.<br>

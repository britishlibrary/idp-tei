              Prods Oktor Skjærvø, a former Norwegian, is now an American
                                citizen. During his Sanskrit studies in Oslo, he acquired an
                                interest in Old Iranian languages in general and Khotanese in
                                particular, following in the footsteps of his compatriot Sten Konow,
                                one of the pioneers of Indic epigraphy and Khotanese language. His
                                work on the Khotanese collections in India Office Library and the
                                British Library (now both in the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/" target="_blank">British Library</a>) from the early
                                1980s onward culminated in an edition of the Khotanese <span class="bibit">Suvarṇabhāsottama-sūtra</span> and a complete
                                Catalogue of the British Library collection (which will be online in
                                2014). He later began concentrating on the eighth-century secular
                                documents in their social and political context, housed mainly in
                                the British Library, Hedin collection (Stockholm), and the Petrovsky
                                collection (St Petersburg), a work that is now being continued, he
                                is happy to say, by his students Zhang Zhan and Wen Xin. His chosen
                                item is <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=IOL%20Khot%20W%201" target="_blank">IOL Khot W 1</a>, a wooden tablet from
                            Dandān-Uiliq.<br>

                This is a double wooden tablet ‘envelope’ consisting of a bottom
                                    with three raised edges and a top (cover) with a handle that
                                    slides into the bottom part. The top has a raised middle part in
                                    which a square hole has been carved out, in which there is a
                                    hole piercing both tablets through which a string was drawn. The
                                    square hole was then filled with clay on which a seal impression
                                    was made. The clay, seal impression, and a piece of the string
                                    are still extant. On the inside surfaces of the closed tablet is
                                    recording of a legal case dated in year one of ‘the gracious
                                    lord, great king of kings of Khotan, Viśya Sīhya’, formerly
                                    unknown. The case concerns the sale (lease) of a man’s brother
                                    to do state work on behalf of the villagers of Birgaṃdara to
                                    help pay their debt. The cover contains a summary of the legal
                                    decision, as the complete decision could only be read by
                                    breaking the seal. This tablet was reused, however, to record
                                    another legal decision on its underside.<br>
                There are two
                                    other similar double wooden tablets in the British Library
                                    collection, that had been long known and published, but this
                                    object had been stored away and was brought to my attention by
                                    Michael O’Keefe during one of my visits. It turned out to herald
                                    a new era of discoveries of such objects. About the same time,
                                    one was published in <span class="bibit">China
                                    Pictorial</span> 1981 that was also dated in the year of Viśya
                                    Sīhya and concerning the sale of a brother’s son (published by
                                    R.E. Emmerick). A few years later, on a visit to Urumqi and
                                    Turfan, I was told of a tablet in the Xinjiang Institute of
                                    Archaeology in Urumqi (no. WBH 01), which I was kindly allowed
                                    to inspect. This tablet recorded the sale by a monastery of a
                                    woman and her son (published by Professor Duan
                                    Qing).<br>
                Since then, a number of such tablets have come to
                                    light in China (now being published by Professor Duan Qing),
                                    which are shedding welcome new light on the history of Khotan in
                                    the late seventh to early eighth centuries.<br>
                To me,
                                        however, it seems like <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=IOL%20Khot%20W%201" target="_blank">IOL Khot W 1</a> was what started this new
                                    spate of discoveries. That is why I choose it as my favourite
                                    object.<br>

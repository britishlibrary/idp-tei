              Victor H. Mair is Professor of Chinese Language and Literature at
                                    the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu" target="_blank">University of
                                    Pennsylvania</a> in Philadelphia, USA. He has been teaching
                                there since 1979, before which he taught at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>.
                                Professor Mair's interest in Central Asia stems mainly from his
                                studies of Dunhuang popular narratives, about which he has written
                                three books and dozens of articles. Developing out of his research
                                on Dunhuang <span class="bibit">biànwén</span> <span class="bibit">變文</span> (transformation
                                texts), he gradually moved into archaeological investigations on the
                                Bronze Age and Early Iron Age mummies of eastern Central Asia. In
                                conjunction with the latter extended project, he has travelled to
                                Xinjiang many times, hosted a major exhibition entitled <span class="bibit">Secrets of the Silk Road</span> in 2011 at the <a href="http://www.penn.museum" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania
                                    Museum</a>, and has published numerous books and articles
                                about the mummies and their associated artefacts.<br>

              Victor H. Mair writes:<br>
              
                The picture scroll depicting the contest of magical conjurations
                                    between Śāriputra and the Six Heretics is my favourite of all
                                    objects from Dunhuang for many reasons. The most immediate
                                    reason is simply its innate charm, the pictures vividly
                                    capturing the excitement of the competition and the details of
                                    the individual scenes.<br>
                Above all, however, is the fact
                                    that this unique scroll holds the key to unlocking the
                                    relationship between pictorial and textual narrative that became
                                    a hallmark of popular fiction and drama in succeeding centuries.
                                    What we find is that the verses on the verso of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=Pelliot%20chinois%204524" target="_blank">Pelliot chinois 4524</a> match the verse portions of the
                                    prosimetric transformation text about Mulian (Maudgalyāyana)
                                    saving his mother from the suffering of the underworld.<br>
                To
                                    show how the picture scroll relates to the transformation text,
                                    I have devoted one entire book <span class="bibit">Painting and

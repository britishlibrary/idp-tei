              Seishi Karashima has been a Professor of Sino-Indian Buddhist
                                Philology at <a href="http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/english.html" target="_blank">The
                                    International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology</a>,
                                Soka University, Tokyo, since 1997, where he has been carrying out
                                philological research on early Mahāyāna scriptures and early Chinese
                                Buddhist translations. He has published twelve books and more than a
                                hundred articles on these themes, including: <span class="bibit">The
                                    Study of the Chinese Versions of the Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra ––

              In the 1990s, he realised that the
                                old Sanskrit manuscripts and fragments from Central Asia were
                                indispensable sources for allowing scholars to draw nearer to the
                                original features of early Mahāyāna scriptures and therefore, since
                                then, he has been engaged in publishing photographs and
                                transliterations of those manuscripts and fragments, now preserved
                                at the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/" target="_blank">British Library</a> and <a href="http://www.orientalstudies.ru/" target="_blank">Institute of Oriental Manuscripts</a> in St.
                                Petersburg. He has also been in the process of publishing a series
                                    of <span class="bibit">Buddhist Manuscripts from Central Asia: The
                                    British Library Sanskrit Fragments</span>(BLSF) (2 vols. so
                                far) and that of <span class="bibit">The St. Petersburg Sanskrit
                                    Fragments</span>(StPSF) (in preparation) in collaboration with
                                K. Wille, M. I. Vorobyova-Desyatovskaya and other
                                scholars.<br>
              His chosen item is the Sanskrit manuscript <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=IOL%20San%20482" target="_blank">IOL San 482</a>.<br>

              Seishi Karashima writes:<br>
              
                The manuscript of the <span class="bibit">Saddharmapuṇḍarīkasūtra</span> (IOL San 482–515), or the <span class="bibit">Lotus Sutra</span>,
                                    was discovered by Aurel Stein in Farhād-Bēg-Yailaki, near
                                    Khadalik, during his second expedition and is kept at present in
                                    the British Library. 35 folios, written on paper, are preserved.
                                    This incomplete manuscript, whose script is the Early Turkestan
                                    Brāhmī, type b, probably dates back to the fifth or sixth
                                    century AD. Both its language (Buddhist Sanskrit) and the
                                    content (from the eleventh to the beginning of the fifteenth
                                    chapter of the <span class="bibit">Lotus Sutra</span>) also show its antiquity. Owing to
                                    its particular importance to the study of the <span class="bibit">Lotus Sutra</span>, a
                                    black-and-white facsimile edition, though of very low quality,
                                    was published as early as 1949 in Japan, from which the late
                                    Prof. Hirofumi Toda made a transliteration.<br>
                When I saw the
                                    actual manuscript with my own eyes at the British Library in
                                    December 2004, I was struck by its beautiful calligraphy and its
                                    absolute clearness, which unfortunately the facsimile edition
                                    lacks. Thus, I decided to transliterate the manuscript anew by
                                    using newly-taken coloured photographs and, at the same time,
                                    persuaded our university to support IDP financially by
                                    digitising the entire collection of the Sanskrit manuscript
                                    fragments from Central Asia. I am happy to know that, now, this
                                    ten-year digitisation project has been completed.<br>

              Agnieszka Helman-Ważny (<a href="http://www.uni-hamburg.de/index_e.html" target="_blank">University of
                                    Hamburg</a>, <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">University of
                                    Arizona</a>) is a paper scientist. Her main research area is
                                the history of paper and books in Tibet and Central Asia, and the
                                development of methods for their examination and conservation. Since
                                2005, she has studied the early history of paper in Central Asia and
                                aimed to create a typology of paper based on a systematic study of
                                manuscript collections found along the Silk Road. She detected a
                                broad range of paper types for these early manuscripts written in
                                Chinese, Tibetan and other languages. By using the technological and
                                microscopic study of paper combined with codicological and textual
                                information, her research undertaken in collaboration with the IDP
                                team has aimed to explore the possibilities for dating this material
                                and recovering the histories of its regional production and usage.
                                Her chosen item is a Tibetan manuscript, <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=IOL%20Tib%20J%20308" target="_blank">IOL Tib J 308</a>, written possibly with blood on fine
                                quality paper.<br>

                <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=IOL%20Tib%20J%20308" target="_blank">IOL Tib J 308</a> was primary selected for our research
                                    because of the unusual ink colour and the fine paper quality.
                                    The manuscript is typical of the Tibetan pothi book format: 9 x
                                    43 cm with one string hole. The leaf proportions and string hole
                                    resemble Indian palm leaf books. The hole, with its abraded
                                    edges, suggests that the book was well used and that its leaves
                                    were string-joined. The Tibetologist Sam van Schaik describes
                                    the copying of the text on this manuscript as a meritorious
                                    activity associated with the achievement of a long life. During
                                    the 830s–840s, many hundreds of copies of this text were made at
                                    the behest of the Tibetan emperor; however, the present copy is
                                    different from these in format and writing style. The script in
                                    this manuscript is in a brown ink easily distinguished from
                                    black carbon-based inks. It is possible that the ink colour is
                                    evidence of the practice of writing with blood, which is also
                                    attested by results of Renate Nöller’s XRF and VIS spectroscopy
                                    examinations.<br>
                This manuscript's paper was produced from
                                    ramie and hemp derived from textile waste. It was made with a
                                    movable type of papermaking mould equipped with a bamboo sieve.
                                    Thus this paper represents laid, regular paper with a sieve
                                    print characterized by 16 laid lines in 3 cm; the laid lines are
                                    horizontal and parallel to the text. The exceptionally good
                                    quality of fibre struck my attention when I was looking at it
                                    under the microscope. My study confirmed that this simple
                                    manuscript without any fancy elements was written on paper made
                                    from high quality textiles. I could envision the raw materials
                                    beaten gently by hand during the papermaking process, to prevent
                                    shortening of the fibres. Those fibres visible on the photograph
                                    above are exceptionally long and well preserved.<br>
                This type
                                    of rag paper, made with one of the oldest papermaking techniques
                                    known and adapted later in Europe, has been found in the
                                    majority of manuscripts from Central Asia produced in the first
                                    millennium but hardly ever later. Thus this Tibetan manuscript,
                                    a common sutra, a scripture from the Buddha, was probably
                                    locally produced at Dunhuang with extreme sincerity and
                                    devotion. It makes me wonder what wish was laid bare by this
                                    person who wrote on such gently-made paper, possibly with the
                                    addition of his own blood. Unfortunately we will never know who
                                    was its creator…<br>

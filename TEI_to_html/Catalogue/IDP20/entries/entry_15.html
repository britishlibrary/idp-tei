              Hans-Ulrich Seidt is currently Director-General for Culture and
                            Communication in the <a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Startseite_node.html" target="_blank">Federal Foreign Office</a> in Berlin. His interest
                                in Central Asia goes back to the late 1980s when he was working as a
                                young diplomat at the West German embassy in Moscow. At that time he
                                had the opportunity to visit the Central Asian republics of the
                                former Soviet Union. It was a fascinating experience and he has
                                returned to Central Asia many times.<br>
              His chosen item is the
                                    wallpainting <a href="http://idp.bbaw.de/database/http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=MIK%20III%208426" target="_blank">MIK III 8426</a> from the collections of the <a href="http://www.smb.museum/museen-und-einrichtungen/museum-fuer-asiatische-kunst/home.html" target="_blank">Museum of Asian Art, Berlin</a>.<br>

                The object I have chosen for the webpage of the International
                                    Dunhuang Project is not from the area of the former Soviet
                                    Union. It comes from China and is today part of the collections
                                    of the Museum of Asian Art in Berlin-Dahlem. The mural was
                                    brought to Berlin during the first decade of the twentieth
                                    century by the German expedition to Turfan. In my eyes this
                                    unique piece of art not only demonstrates the general wealth and
                                    prosperity along the ancient silk roads but also the
                                    multi-ethnic character of their urban trade
                            centres.<br>

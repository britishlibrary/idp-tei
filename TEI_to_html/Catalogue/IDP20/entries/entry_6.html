                It so happened that through my
                                    visual memory I always remember the images from Dunhuang. In my
                                    childhood my father, Lev Nikolaevitch Menshikov, showed me the
                                    pictures of the ceiling ornaments, books with the reproductions
                                    and photographs of the Mogao Thousand Buddhas caves. And on
                                    Sundays papa took me to the museums and of course to the
                                    Hermitage and the rooms with the Dunhuang collection. Maybe it
                                    was my childish impression but in the exhibition the most
                                    attractive for me were the fantastic beasts, the dogs that sat
                                    in the middle of the room in the glass cages. I was not afraid
                                    of them but thought they were looking at me breathing and
                                    smiling as the real pets can.<br>
                Two sculptures of the
                                    fantastic animals were brought from Dunhuang to St. Petersburg
                                    in 1915 by the second Russian Turkestan Expedition, led by
                                    academician Sergei Feodorovitch Oldenburg. No other such beasts
                                    from Dunhuang are known or have survived. They must be the pair
                                    of seated guardians at the entrance to the Buddhist cave. One of
                                    them is shown with the open mouth like roaring, the second with
                                    the closed mouth but tentative. They are vigorous and listen to
                                    the sounds of the world. Any moment they are ready to protect
                                    the Buddhist faith from any evil.<br>

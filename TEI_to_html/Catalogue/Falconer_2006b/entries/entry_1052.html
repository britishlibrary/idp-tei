              PUBLISHED: Prints 93-96 form a 'Panoramic view taken near southern end of Niya site showing remains of ancient dwelling (A), tank with surrounding arbour (B), and footbridge (C) stretched across dry river-bed, all abandoned during the third century A.D.' Inserted in 'Ruins of Desert Cathay', vol. 1, p. 296. Additional descriptive text reads: 'The panorama was taken from the top of a tamarisk-covered sand-cone, and extends from S.E. (left) to W. (right). In the foreground behind the ruined dwelling (N. XLI., A) and tank (see i. pp. 295 sqq.) are seen the remains of dead trees and fences marking lines of ancient avenues and gardens. The figure of a man near ancient bridge (C) indicates the height of trestles still upright. Beyond left bank of dry river-bed are the remains of dead orchards (D) near what appears to have been a large reservoir. In near background, to south and south-west, chains of tamarisk cones; high ridges of dunes in distance.' Prints 93-96 also form 'Serindia', I, fig. 75, with caption similar to above.<br>

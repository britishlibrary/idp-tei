              Prints 289-292 form four sections (first section on left, presumably print 288, is missing) of a five-part panorama, entitled 'Panoramic view taken from crest of watershed above Huo-ning-to Pass, showing portions of the Richtofen, To-lai-shan and Alexander III ranges of Nai-shan'. PUBLISHED: 'Ruins of Desert Cathay', vol. 2, p. 314. The explanatory text continues: 'The panorama was taken at an elevation of circ. 15,500 feet to the north-west of the pass, which itself is hidden by rocky foreground (D; see ii. pp. 314 sqq. and Map III). The view extends from the north-east (left) to the south-west (right); the entries above the panorama indicate only the approximate bearings. It shows portions of the Richtofen Range west (A) and east (B) of Hung-shui-pa Ho, rising to peaks of over 18,000 feet. The high peaks of the To-lai-shan Range, over which the pass leads, are masked by neighbouring ridges (C) [print 289]. Across the wide valley of the Pei-ta Ho are seen in the distance the Uge-shan group (E) [print 290], rising to close on 19,000 feet, and other snowy portions of the Alexander III Range (F to H) [prints 291-292]. The approximate position of the pass by which we crossed this range is indicated by (G) [extreme right of print 291]. For a view from the same point to the north-west see Fig. 237 [Photo 392/26 (388)].' Stein describes the taking of this view on p. 315: 'The atmosphere was delightfully clear, and with the pleasure of getting this chance for a photographic panorama I scarcely noticed the icy wind which played over our narrow arÃªte. So wild was the confusion of its fissured rocks that to keep the camera secure and take exposures all round cost much trouble. So when the work was accomplished I was glad to hurry down to the pass which our baggage train had just crossed in safety...'<br>

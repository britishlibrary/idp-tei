He had been sent up from Badakhshan by Prince Nasrullah, brother of the Amir and General Commanding in the Oxus Provinces, to assure my safe passage through the Afghan territory on the Pamirs. After patiently waiting for me at Sarhad for over four weeks he now offered me the warmest of welcomes...' (Ruins of Desert Cathay, vol. 1, p. 65).

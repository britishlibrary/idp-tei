              'So my ride to Mastuj on May 11th gave ample chance for collecting useful information. The morning hours were spent in taking copies and photographs of a Sanskrit inscription and a rock-carved Stupa representation closely resembling those of Pakhturinidini. The large boulder on which both are engraved was brought to light in a field near Charrun only some eight years ago...' Ruins of Desert Cathay, vol. 1, p. 44.

              PUBLISHED: 'Ruins of Desert Cathay', vol 1, fig. 18: 'Bahadur khan, Governor of Mastuj, seated in centre with his two sons; Khan Sahib Pir Bakhsh on his right, and Mastuji attendants'. 'At the bridge leading back to the left bank old Bahadur Khan, the actual ruler of Mastuj and a cousin of the Chitral chief, awaited me in person with two youthful sons. Though close on eighty years, the portly white-haired chief seemed still full of vigour and genuine enjoyment of life and its pleasures...His straightforward, simple ways, full of old-fashioned courtesy withal, have made him a favourite with all European officials in Chitral' ('Ruins of Desert Cathay', vol 1, p. 46).<br>

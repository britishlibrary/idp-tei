              It will be seen that the translation of this interesting, but unfortunately
                imperfect, document becomes in the latter part very doubtful and in fact
                conjectural. But the general sense is clear, and the geographical information is
                valuable. The route laid down is from Little Nob (M카r훮n) to Kwa cu (An-hsi); and it
                is evidently contemplated that it should be the direct mountain route and not follow
                the desert edge via Shan-shan. The document
                supplies two important facts, namely the first that, as has been intimated above (p.
                31), and will be more abundantly shown later, the Tsal
                  byi command included M카r훮n, and secondly, that the town of Khar tsan (for this is clearly the name to be completed in the
                lacuna) was attached to An-hsi. As regards the other places mentioned, the Upper
                  Tsog district (<span class="bibit">sde</span>)
                mentioned, the Nyan rna district and 'Brog Slungs (the Nomad Slungs), Tsog has been
                mentioned above (p. 11), and with 'Brog Slungs
                we may compare the Rgya Slungs, Chinese Slungs, of M.Tagh.c.iii.0043 (IOL Tib N 2285) (pp.
                  276-7)<span class="smaller"> [note 1: Other references for Slungs are p. 296:23 (M.Tagh.a.iv.0092, IOL Tib N 1708) (a
                  person's 'card' of wood Rgya Slungs 'Bog lang), p. 296:24
                  (M.Tagh.a.vi.003, IOL Tib N 1755), p. 431:1 (M.Tagh.c.iii.0022, IOL Tib N 2088)
                    (byang Slungs), p. 64:11J (IOL Tib N 692) (Slungs in connection with Snying tsoms), M.I.xliii.002 (IOL Tib N 1048) (Slungs), Chronicle, l. 169 (Slungs stod
                  smad): see pp. 296-7 (M.I.xv.0020, IOL Tib N 749).] </span>: perhaps the word is
                connected with Tibetan <span class="bibit">lung</span>"a valley" and means "the people of the Valley".
                  Nyang rna has not yet been found: since the
                word is used in the sense of a "messenger" we might translate "Bong La ku of the messenger
                  division (<span class="bibit">sde</span>)".<br>
              Concerning the names Mog Kyem po and Bong La ku see the classified list. Rings pa (l. 7) = "runner" (cf. p. 136.3: M.I.ii.40,
                Or.15000/293).<br>
              The expression rad pa (l. 6) occurs not very infrequently in the
                documents: that it means a travelling party (<span class="bibit">bgrod</span>?) appears
                from several documents, e.g. p. 141. 3-4 (M.I.xiv.109.a, Or.15000/426), rad pa gsum mjald te"three parties (caravans
                met)", pp. 61 (M.I.xiv.113, Or.15000/430), 205 (M.Tagh.a.iv.007, IOL Tib N
                1631), 371 (M.Tagh.b.i.002, IOL Tib N 2270), 378 (M.I.viii.3, IOL Tib N 377).
                M.Tagh.i.0027 (Or.15000/42), M.I.iii.21 (Or.15000/301). Khor is

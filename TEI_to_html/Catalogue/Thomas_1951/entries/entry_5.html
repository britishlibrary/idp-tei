                "[ll.1-4] Spring of the Bird year: the wife of Leng ho Ling lug of Rgod, Song Sam nyang, in employment
                  with Be'u zhan, female servant of Leng ho Shib tig, having exchanged four cups,
                  three register baskets (<span class="bibit">deb tse</span>?) and woven (<span class="bibit">spun</span>) cotton material, half a <span class="bibit">rkya ma</span>,
                  these belonging to Shib bir, are to be given
                  back by the fifth day of the last spring month of the Dog-year [ll.4-6] at the
                  door of Leng ho Shib bir. If not delivered
                  at the time, one is to become two. Also whatever barely or copper-utensils or cups
                  are in her possession are to be taken without protest. [ll.6-10] As furthermore
                  four less a half weights of cotton and four <span class="bibit">bre</span> of Chinese
                  barely, together with the key of the door-bolt, were obtained in pledge, to be
                  redeemed by the tenth day of the middle spring month of the Dog-year, if these are
                  not redeemed in time, the iron (<span class="bibit">rgyu</span>?) of the door-bolt
                  also is to be exacted; in attestation whereof the witness seals of Cang Gu gu, La
                    Legs lod, Khe'u Bzang gong, and ...
                  and the rest, and the written signature of the women's husband, (Leng ho) Ling lug, and the finger size-mark of Sam nyang are attached."
              <br>
              (Endorsement)<br>
              
                "[1] Hand of the husband, Leng ho Ling
                    lug. Hand of Khe'u Bzang gong [2]
                  in writing. Finger-size-mark of Song Sam
                  nyang."
              <br>
              It will be seen that Leng ho Ling lug, whose
                surname, recurrent at Sha cu (see p. 115), is
                possibly identical with Ling hu known from
                Chinese sources (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Chavannes_1913: Index</a>), is described as "of Rgod". This is, however,
                hardly sufficient to prove that the Sha cu
                itself was in the Rgod division.<br>
              Concerning the names (e.g. Shib tig = "Ten beauty", <span class="bibit">daśa-śrī</span>), see pp. 71-3
                (Ch.75.iii.3, IOL Tib J 1240) and the list, infra, pp. 113 sqq.<br>

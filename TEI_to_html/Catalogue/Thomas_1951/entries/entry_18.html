              The document again is therefore simply a systematically arranged list of
                monasteries receiving as income the crops of certain farms, with the names of the
                owners or occupants of the farms, who are styled yon bdag (<span class="bibit">dana-pati</span>"donors" or "patrons"). Though we have only a
                fragment, the number of establishments, many of which may have been small, is
                sufficient to remind us of the fact that Sha cu
                was the place of the "Thousand Buddhas"; and the system, though
                perhaps the produce only, and not also the ownership, of estates, belonged to the
                monasteries, is agreeably analogous to the holdings of the Tibetan Buddhist church
                and of the endowments of religion and learning in mediaeval Europe.<br>
              The names of the religious establishments, which are grouped under the several
                accounts according to their initial syllables, may conveniently be reproduced in the
                same manner: -<br>

              The names of these monasteries exhibit, as will be seen, a certain sameness. They
                consist for the most part of combinations of well-known Buddhist or Indian phrases,
                such as dri med (= <span class="bibit">amala</span>, <span class="bibit">nirmala</span>), rnam dag (= <span class="bibit">viśuddha</span>),
                  dga' ldan (= <span class="bibit">tuṣita</span>), rin
                  chen (= <span class="bibit">ratna</span>), chos grags (= <span class="bibit">dharma-kīrti</span>), g.yung 'drung (= <span class="bibit">svastika</span>), don dam (= <span class="bibit">paramārtha</span>), bsam yas (= <span class="bibit">acintya</span>), khams gsum (= <span class="bibit">tri loka</span>),
                  bla med (= <span class="bibit">anuttara</span>), byams pa (= <span class="bibit">Maitreya</span>), dngos grub
                (= <span class="bibit">siddhi</span>). They are all Tibetan, but may represent Sanskrit
                or Chinese originals.<br>
              It remains to justify the translation of tshan, which has
                occurred already several times (p. 40: Ch.83.vi.5, IOL Tib J 1383, p. 42: Ch.80.v.1,
                IOL Tib J 844, p. 83: Ch,73.xv.5, IOL Tib J 1359), by "account"
                and to explain the phrase "khram""account".<br>
              Tshan cannot have the common senses of "class",
                  "group", "a number of", or of "mark", "name" (<span class="bibit">mtshan</span>), or of "office". The sense of "account" (cf. <span class="bibit">yig tshang</span>) fits the occurrences. For khram
                (going back to <span class="bibit">khra ma</span>"register", etc.?) we may cite <span class="bibit">khram kha</span>"chart used in witchcraft", "cross marks cut into a
                  piece of wood", and <span class="bibit">khram shing</span>"board on which the body of a culprit is stretched to flog him on the
                  back". Remembering to numerous wooden sticks with combinations of lines and
                frequently with names amounts, we can hardly hesitate to recognize in the khram tshan these same tallies, such as were frequent in England
                down to the seventeenth century.<span class="smaller"> [note 2: In the business, for

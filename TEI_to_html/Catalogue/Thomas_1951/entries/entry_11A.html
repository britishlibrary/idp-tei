                "[1] At the beginning of the first summer month of the Mouse year:
                  district of Tshas stobs. [2-3] At the
                  beginning of the first summer month of the Mouse year: district of Snying tsoms. Belonging to Lha skyes some three loads of wheat and barely having
                  previously been required (<span class="bibit">g.yar du</span>?) 'on loan' by Sag Dge legs of district Rgod sar, as regards the time of rendering it back, it is
                  the middle autumn month of the present year. [4-5] Until death (or until this is
                  effected? <span class="bibit">gum</span> = <span class="bibit">khums</span>), half a
                    <span class="bibit">bre</span> is agreed (? <span class="bibit">bzangsu</span>? as
                  interest): the delivery of the <span class="bibit">bre</span> is to take place
                  without interruption at one time at the door of Lha
                    skyes. [6-9] If it is not then delivered, or if trickery is attempted,
                  the amount becomes doubled. Present goods at his house with their increase,
                  outside cattle and things indoors, tools, clothes on his back, wherever put, may
                  be seized according to the old usage without a word of protest. [9-11]
                  Alternatively, if Dge legs is not at home or
                  if through consideration of the part of His Excellency a division is made, then
                  the witnesses to the agreement and a guarantor upon a demand [at their residences]
                  by letter in accordance with the outcome of the above indenture are required to
                  deliver: [11-12] in attestation whereof of the attestation marks and written
                  signatures of....and the others are attached."
              <br>
              The agreement is a draft, as appears from the fact that in l. 1 a different
                document was commenced, and also from the gaps left in ll. 11-12 for insertion of
                the names of witnesses, etc. Concerning the phrases zhal cu, dam gong nas byung, brgya la, we may refer to the
                notes on the similar document discussed infra, p. 145 (M.I.xliv.7, Or.15000/530).
                This instrument comes from the Tun-huang library (it is written on the back of a
                MS.) and relates to the Sha cu region.<br>
              l. 1. Tshas stobs: This district has not
                hitherto been found.<br>
              ll. 2-3. Snying tsoms and Rgod sar: On these districts see the references in pp. 40
                (Ch.83.vi.5, IOL Tib J 1383), 83 (Ch.73.xv.5, IOL Tib J 1359).<br>
              l. 3. Sag: On this clan name see pp. 50 (Ch.73.iv.14, IOL
                Tib J 134), 115.<br>
              l. 4. bzangsu: Reading and sense uncertain.<br>
              l. 5. myi chad par: This seems clearly to mean "without interruption"; one would have preferred "if the
                  delivery of the <span class="bibit">bre</span> is not carried out".<br>
              ll. 6-7. gcig la gnyisu..bsgyur: Cf. p. 45. 4-5 (back of
                Ch.86.ii, IOL Tib J 850) and Index.<br>
              l. 7. phyi phyi(a)g...rgyab 'gos: The rendering is somewhat
                uncertain.<br>
              l. 9. bkur te gung chad du: the rendering is uncertain.<br>

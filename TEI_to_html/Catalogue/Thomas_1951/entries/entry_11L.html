                "[ll. 1-3] Loan [on the part] of Ser
                    Dzin kheng: one Chinese cord and ten short pieces of paper being in the
                  hands of Li'i Klu rton, as regards the time
                  of payment, it was arranged that payment should be made to Dzin kheng, wherever he should be, on the twentieth day of
                  the last winter month of the Dragon year. [3-5] If at that time payment should not
                  have been made, the paper and the Chinese cord should both become double: three
                  bonds not being required, procedure according to custom should be taken upon the
                  last bond singly, and Klu rton's (by the
                  last bond 'and Shi'u kin's') [property],
                  wherever found, may be seized without a single word of complaint. [5-7] In
                  attestation of which agreement the attestation seals of Sag Stag slebs, 'Im 'Bye
                    le'u, Khang Mang zigs, Song Lug lug and the rest, and the
                  finger-measure of the hand of Klu rton are
                  impressed. [Inverted] Klu rton not having a
                  hand-signature his finger-measure is impressed."

              This legal document is on the same lines as No. 5. For the clan names Ser, Li'u, Sag,
                  'Im, Khang, Song, see the consolidated list.<br>
              l. 1, Rgya thag gcig: This might mean "one
                  seal-cord"; but, since Dzin kheng has a
                Chinese name, the given rendering is more probable.<br>
              shog shog: The usual reduplicated form, as p. 84. B1.<br>
              chags: See pp. 258.10 (M.Tagh.b.i.00104, Or.15000/192), 323.<br>
              l. 4, dam phyis...: The syntax is here obscure: we gather that
                  Shi'u kin is to be included, as a guarantor,
                in the last agreement.<br>
              "According to custom": On ring lugs see p. 16
                (IOL Tib J 1368).<br>
              l. 5, zhal mchu: See pp. 59.8 (Ch.82, IOL Tib j 1018), 180
                (M.Tagh.0050), and Index.<br>
              l. 7, mdzub tshad: See p. 46.1-2 (Ch.86.ii, IOL Tib J 850).<br>
              mdzub: The alternative, less usual, form, mdzug, which here follows, recurs also in p. 75. B9 (IOL Tib J 1254): in p.
                74.11 mdzub reappears. Cf. the -b/-g in <span class="bibit">Nob</span>/<span class="bibit">Nag</span>.<br>

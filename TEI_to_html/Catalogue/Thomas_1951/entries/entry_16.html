                "Counted in the school of Stag Su
                  tam and Bran ce'u. In this bundle of
                  chapters are: of three rolls, chapters seventy nine; of four rolls, chapters
                  thirteen; of rolls five less a half chapter one; of rolls four less a half,
                  chapters seven. On a total reckoning, for one hundred chapters it comes to rolls
                  of paper three hundred and eighteen."
              <br>
              The word translated "school" is gra, which we
                have taken for <span class="bibit">grwa</span>. The form gra occurs
                in the next document (No. 17, IOL Tib J 689, ll. 3-5); but possibly the word written
                is gu, which might have the sense of "room". It
                is a fortunate chance which, after preserving to us records of ordering and paying
                for copying of MSS. and of method of employing and rewarding the labour, has in this
                complete and legible wooden tablet given us a label relating to a parcel placed
                ready, no doubt, for transmission.<br>
              It will be noted that the number of chapters is correctly added (100). The number
                of rolls, 318, is the total of (3 x 79 =) 237 + (4 x 13 =) 52 + 4 ½ + (3 ½ x 7 =) 24
                ½.<br>

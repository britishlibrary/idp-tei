                "[ll. 1-2] To the Minister of the Interior, Councillor G.yu bzher, letter-petition of Khris legs. I am very glad to hear that on the part of you,
                  equal to a theophany, there is no recurrence of your old illness. [ll. 2-4] As
                  regards the fact that, though I sent various letters before this inquiring as to
                  your health, no answer has come, and whereas I, a humble 'A
                  zha, have sent various presents: Minister of the Interior, styled of the
                    Ser sbyon family of Kwa
                    chu, residing in your seat at Hi ma
                  te, engaged in saving(?) counsels, from the army also...five...very great
                  distance...your servant is ill at ease. [ll. 4-5] There being unequalled advantage
                  in carrying on the business even while you are in your residence, when the
                  courier's missive and the substance of the orders came to Bde gams, it was opportune for me to submit matter to my
                  superiors(?). [ll. 5-6] Having sent down a verbal order that 'a courier's missive
                  having come into the country, carry out the orders (or punish)...,' I sent to the
                  palace of the census (<span class="bibit">rtsi sar</span>). [ll. 6-7] As regards the
                  law, the decision to punish having...one year..., accordingly begged to be not
                  weak. [ll. 7-10] Afterwards, being more hopeful than before, and relying upon the
                  business (instructions), your humble servant submitted in council that it was
                  right to act in accordance with the business undertaken (instructions received?).
                  The ten brothers being the leaders(?)...as to sending up to...<span class="bibit">bzher</span>, no advantage whatever was effected, and in the meeting nothing at
                  all being possible, it was ordered more or less that your humble servant should
                  constantly write inquires as to health. 'From Mdo
                    gams, some market merchandize, very rotten, early and later...things and
                  general indifference (<span class="bibit">sga g.yer</span>?)', so it was said. Having
                  regard to the saying, 'at a brother's door usually...'we have sent a signed letter
                  of inquires as to health. If you send a letter, please trouble to send by this
                  courier."

              l. 10. snyan snyungs"a letter of inquires after health" seems to mean merely a formal
                letter of that nature (cf. p. 22: back of Ch.87.xiii, IOL Tib J 856). We have
                several among the documents.<br>

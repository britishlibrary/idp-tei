              It is needless to proceed with this lengthy document, which consists entirely of
                entries of the types: -<br>
              (a) Sha cu pha Rgod gyi sde Leng za Se'u se'u//dge slong ma The'i
                  cing//<br>
              
                "Sha cu, Rgod division: Leng za Se'u
                    se'u; <span class="bibit">bhikṣuṇī</span> (nun) The'i cing."
              <br>
              (b) Sha cu pha Rgod gyi sde Then za Beng 'em//dge slong ma 'Bye'u
                  'dzi//Sha cu pha dge slong ma Kwag za Ji lim gyi bran mo Kwag za Tam tam dge slong
                  ma Thong ce'u<br>
              
                "Sha cu, Rgod division: Then za Beng
                    'em; <span class="bibit">bhikṣuṇī</span>'Bye'u 'dzi; female servant of Sha cu<span class="bibit">bhikṣuṇī</span>Kwag za Ji lim, Kwag za Tam tam, <span class="bibit">bhikṣuṇī</span>Thong ce'u."
              <br>
              In a portion of the instances the "division" (sde) specified is not Rgod, but Dar pa. In most cases the mistress of a female
                servant or slave (bran mo) is described not merely as <span class="bibit">bhikṣuṇī</span>, but as "<span class="bibit">bhikṣuṇī</span>
                  of Sha cu or of a Sha cu man" (Sha cu pha dge slong ma).
                Two women are called "subject of the Sha
                    cu queen" (Sha cu pha Btsan mo'i 'bangs); five are
                servants of a <span class="bibit">bhikṣu</span>, and about fourteen of persons not
                stated to be <span class="bibit">bhikṣu</span>s, but who probably are men; many are not
                servants at all, and one is granddaughter (tsha mo) of a <span class="bibit">bhikṣu</span>.<br>
              What then is the relation of the <span class="bibit">bhikṣuṇī</span> to the person,
                probably always a woman, whose name precedes? The obvious interpretation is that the
                relationship was some kind of guardianship. It may be suggested that the function
                was that of spiritual adviser or "pious friend" (<span class="bibit">kalyāṇa-mitra</span>), abundantly exemplified (vol. i <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Thomas_1935</a>, see Index) in the case of members of Khotan royal families.<br>
              In any case we have a good number of feminine names, which may prove linguistically
                instructive. From evident instances, such as Hwa sim"Flower-heart", Meng tig
                  "<span class="bibit">Prabhā-śrī</span>", Tig nem"Obtain-memory", Hwa 'gem"Flower-mass", Bo de sim
                  "<span class="bibit">Bodhi-hṛdaya (citta)</span>", we infer that the majority will be
                recognizable as Chinese. These names of <span class="bibit">bhikṣuṇī</span>s lack for
                the most part the clan-prefix.<br>
              The feminine names are partly of the same appearance as those in the other
                documents. In about a score of cases the second syllable is nyang.
                Instances such as Shib nyang, Shib lug nyang, Shib si
                nyang, Shim si nyang, commencing with
                what we can prove to be the Chinese for "10", "16", and "14", suggest that nyang is nothing else than the Chinese niang"girl", perhaps used in large families, where the female children
                bore no special names.<br>
              A feature of the clan-prefixes is the addition of the syllable za
                to forms which elsewhere we find not so attended; thus in this document we have not
                  Cang and Sag, but Cang za and Sag za. The phenomenon has presented
                itself before (p. 50: Ch.73.iv.14, IOL Tib J 134): it is usual in the surnames of
                Tibetan women, being in fact, merely a form of bza'"woman", "wife".<br>
              All the names will be found in the general list.<br>

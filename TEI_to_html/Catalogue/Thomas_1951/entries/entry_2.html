                  Account of Cang Ka dzo. Cang Kun tse, agent to Byi
                    btsan, the corn official of the old year at wheat two less a half loads
                  and four <span class="bibit">bre</span>, the orders of the chief (<span class="bibit">rtse rje</span>) were that it should be delivered in the autumn of the Hog
                  year. (ll. 3-5) There was a change in the lists, and in the middle spring month of
                  the Hog year there came a letter stating that some corn had been granted by the
                  General to the Thub brtan abbot. Thereupon
                  the superintendents (<span class="bibit">gnyer pa</span> 'the persons in charge'),
                    Dar Rgyal ma and Tre Mye slebs and the others, made the levy. (ll. 5-7) Two
                  less a half loads and four <span class="bibit">bre</span> of wheat were delivered to
                    Byi brtsan, the corn official for the old
                  year, on the eleventh day of the middle spring month of the present year. (ll.
                  7-8) In witness of Byi brtsan's receipt seal
                  having been given the attestation seals of Bam Stag
                    slebs, Dze'u Gog tsheng, Cang Klu legs and so forth are (here)
                given." (Several seal impressions illegible)<br>
              (Endorsement, inverted): "The despatch has been carried out. The
                  amount is impressed by marks (<span class="bibit">shad kyis gnan</span>)."<br>
              l.1: tshan: see p. 91 (Ch.73.viii.5, IOL Tib J 1357) below.<br>
              Concerning stsang = "corn", mngan = "government", "authority", see pp.
                19 (Fragment.67, IOL Tib J 1126), 341 (Ch.86.ii, IOL Tib J 848).<br>
              gnyer"to be in charge of", "to be placed in charge
                of", and gnyer 'gum (<span class="bibit">bkum</span>, <span class="bibit">khums</span>) "to carry out a charge" are among the
                most common expressions in these Tibetan documents, whether on paper or on wood. For
                examples see the next documents and pp. 19 (Fragment.67, IOL Tib J 1126), 79 (IOL
                Tib J 1254), 358: 40 (M.I.xiv.0016, IOL Tib N 552). etc.<br>
              l. 2: khal"load" is no doubt technical = Sanskrit <span class="bibit">vƒÅha</span>.<br>
              l. 4: We understand "the Thub
                  brtan abbot" to be connected with the previously mentioned Byi brtsan.<br>
              As regards the intervention of "the General" (dmag dpon), cf. the
                document given above (pp. 19-20).<br>
              l. 6: lan = "year", as often (e.g. p. 75.B 7:
                IOL Tib J 1254, p. 137. 1: M.I.xiv.109.b, Or.15000/426 ?).<br>
              l. 9: In (conjecturally) interpreting chags as "measure" or "weight" and chags rgya (in
                the addendum) as "record of measure or weight" we may appeal to
                the expression <span class="bibit">chag khongs</span>"basket for measuring grain", <span class="bibit">chag tshad</span>"correct measure", <span class="bibit">tshags</span>"a sieve", <span class="bibit">tshags bu</span>"a bag attached to a sieve", <span class="bibit">tshags dam po</span>"strict care", <span class="bibit">tshags tshad</span>"to test properly". The word shad usually
                denotes the vertical line used in punctuation: and, in fact, some of the documents
                seem to show lines of such a kind appended to signify numbers. In this connexion the
                word gnan, which should mean "pressed", may
                possibly denote "confirmed" or "reinforced": or
                were the signs actually "impressed" upon the measures or bundles
                or parcels? As regards the persons, see the consolidated list (pp. 113 sqq.).<br>

                From the time when 'O lde Spu
                  rgyal came from the gods of heaven to be lord of men, and ever in other
                  exalted bodies – with great dominion, good religion, and other great science, a
                  royal lineage unbroken as far as the origin of the land where the kingdom arose –
                  with the kind sway of a sovereignty firm on all sides and great filled and
                  encompassed the Eight Regions; to us 'Greng people,
                  without and within, equally considerate; by their influence and measures taming
                  the high and proud and bringing them under the rule of right: with joy and
                  encouragement in both present and future extolling the humble and afflicted;
                  filling us 'Greng people beneath the ends of heaven with
                  perpetual kindness; rulers of the Four Quarters of the great heaven, equal to the
                  manner of the divine, their Majesties the <span class="bibit">Btsan po</span>s of
                  Tibet, of the divine descent-
              <br>
              
                [89a, l. 1] Furthermore, established in his place, the pure and, his
                  high kingdom, above great rivers and at the foot of high snow-mountains, His
                  Divine Majesty, the <span class="bibit">Btsan po</span>, in the counting of the
                  generations of his line (not?) equal to the manner of the gods, is beyond other
                  kings manifestly great and permanent.
              <br>
              
                [89a, l. 3] Of ancestry thus rivalling the gods, furthermore also
                  great sovereign and of firm helmet, His Divine Majesty, the <span class="bibit">Btsan
                    po</span>Khri Gtsug lde brtsan, in body firm knit, in
                  mind divinely endowed, with due foundation of all monasteries gives joy [to the
                  people], headed by the great persons, their shepherds, and even all the gods and
                    <span class="bibit">Nāga</span>s of heaven and earth.
              <br>
              
                [89a, l. 4] At the time when, through his great compassionateness
                  towards us 'Greng people, the great authority of his
                  government spread and flourished, protecting us with respect in a manner
                  resembling heaven, there came into power certain exalted councillors of the state,
                  the Great Councillor, Uncle Khri sum rje,
                  and the Great Uncle Lha bzang po, these two.
                  Humbling the might of enemies and setting them in the bosom of the state, by the
                  power and influence of their stern commands they tamed all the border kings, of
                  China, the Drug, the 'Jang and
                  others, till then venturing and making effort for dominion, and cut short their
                  hopes. After long time, when righteous and prosperous kindness had engendered
                  trust and encouragement, as though heaven were realized in men's minds, some
                  several states, respectfully heading the orders of the high councillors of Tibet,
                  made this great concordat of states; whereby, to say nought of ephemeral good and
                  happiness both in present and future, there is among friend and foe alike reason
                  profound indeed for extolling and celebrating the bosom of the state. Through
                  myriad millenniums, undiminishingly beneficial and welcome, may this great,
                  publicly enacted concordat, known and witnessed by the Three Jewels and by all
                  gods and <span class="bibit">Nāga</span>s of the universe, stand for all time
                  unimpaired and firm. The subjects of the several kingdoms, by virtue of the thus
                  enacted great concordat, consigning to oblivion their sufferings during the time
                  of arms, and being united at one time in a situation of felicity, through the
                  great merit thereof may His Divine Majesty, the honoured <span class="bibit">Btsan po</span>Khri Gtsug lde brtsan and the great
                  councillors of State, successful in righteous achievement, the Great Councillors,
                  Uncle Khri sum rje and Great Uncle Lha bzang and the rest, together with their
                  retinue of High Councillors of Tibet, and all beings, cleansed from the double
                  darkness, and fulfilling their store of merit and wisdom, finally in supreme,
                  perfected enlightenment attain to consummate Buddhahood [90n, l. 2].
              <br>
              
                In respect of the choice of this place as site for the foundation of
                  the monastery erected on the De ga
                  Turquoise-Wood Concordat Plain and for biennial convention of the three great
                  kingdoms and four great foundations, the site being moreover one fully blessed by
                    <span class="bibit">Ārya</span>s of old, may it furthermore, through a foundation
                  in respect of such great good realized at one time, be even more manifestly of
                  great merit and auspiciousness. And through the grandeur of those great merits may
                  this monastery be perpetual in time, as long as sun and moon exist; and on the
                  part of His Divine Majesty, the <span class="bibit">Btsan po</span>Khri Gtsug lde brtsan, may there be long
                  life, great dominion, and purposes accomplished according to his mind.
              <br>
              
                Whereas formerly, in the time when China and the Drug were not in accord and harmony with the State, the firm-helmeted
                  prince and the wise, heroic councillors, in the ardour of their warlike skill,
                  smote at the foe and by the mighty power of large armies laid low enemy cities,
                  won battles, conquered countries, slew the people and so forth, may the sin of
                  severing the lives of many enemy men and cattle and of taking what was not given
                  be altogether dominated by the splendour and power of this great merit and be
                  dissolved and washed away.
              <br>
              
                [91b, l. 1] In condevotion with the merit of this donation in honour
                  of the Three Jewels and of the confession of sins and so forth supplication for
                  insight, for tolerance, and for remission of the confessed is made equally with
                  what is above set forth.

              <br>
              
                Whereas in the lifetime of the High Councillor of Tibet, the
                  firm-helmeted Sgam dkyel the Great, – for
                  till then the three great kingdoms of China, the Drug, and
                  the 'Jang were resolute in contending for dominion, – the
                  firm-helmeted lord designed to issue command that by the heroic might of his jewel
                  councillors the enemy should be made to come beneath his sway, in founding a
                  monastery erected to celebrate, as long as tradition of human generations endures,
                  that that design is willed to be dominated and is covered up by kind summons to
                  righteousness, and in thereby setting a crown upon the state's supremacy, may the
                  purpose in the mind of the prince Khri Gtsug lde
                    brtsan have been accomplished; and may the harm done to the enemy by
                  Great Councillor Uncle Khri sum rje and
                  Great Uncle Lha bzang through great defeats
                  of the hostile Chinese and Drug and other means great and
                  small, and on the part of certain of the city of Mkhar tsan, who, taking side with the stubborn heroic people of Tibet
                  and being foremost of heroes in winning two great victories in a single year, on
                  behalf of the venture for dominion on the part of the lord and people of Tibet
                  went forward with a will to harm animate creatures, so that wounds were needs
                  inflicted, may those wounds likewise be healed so that not a scar remains! – with
                  this prayer the great city Khar tsan has made
                  donation.
              <br>
              
                [92b l. 1] PRAYER OFFERED FROM THE GREAT CITY OF KWA CU AT THE MONASTERY ERECTED AT THE DE GA TURQUOISE-WOOD.
              <br>
              (This repeats 91b, l. 2 as far "on behalf of the venture for dominion
                  on the part of the lord and people of Tibet" and then continues) were willing to proceed with force in harming the enemy, may that without a
                  remainder be healed! – with this prayer the great city of Kwa cu has made donation.<br>
              
                [93a l. 3] PRAYER OFFERED BY THE COMMANDANT OF THE PHYUG TSAMS THOUSAND, HIMSELF AND HIS SUBORDINATES.
              <br>
              
                Hail to the Three Jewels! Hail to the Buddha, to the Omniscient! Hail to the <span class="bibit">Dharma</span>,
                  to the Path without superior! Hail to the <span class="bibit">Saṃgha</span>, to the

                  Jewels in order to the success of the efforts of ourselves and others, having
                  dismissed all sins and consenting to what is meritorious, we turn and cleave to
                  the Three Jewels. That by inspired design in the mind of the firm-helmeted High
                  Councillor Thugs skam the Chinese, the Drug, the 'Jang and others, until then
                  heedless of commands, were set at rest equally with the native people and bidden
                  to seek a shelter both firm-helmeted and great; that a concordat was framed and
                  inscribed upon a stone pillar; that after foundation of the monastery [here]
                  erected the border cities are at peace and in the interior of the great countries
                  happiness has been made to flourish – forasmuch as there has been no greater
                  kindness than this, in token of reverential and kind commemoration donation has
                  been made to the Three Jewels: through the merit whereof may the lord of Tibet
                  with his retinue of councillors enjoy long life and authority on all sides, and in
                  the Tibetan realm, while foreign enemy and strife are unmentioned and the year's
                  wealth is perpetually assured in accordance with rightful ordinance, may there be
                  mundane and super-mundane happiness and felicity in perfection.
              <br>
              
                PRAYER OFFERED BY THE DISTRICT 'BROM

              <br>
              
                The lord stationed on high a god; the councillors of the state
                  inspired; the rift of heaven through divinely inspired High Councillors
                  embroidered with divine blessing; the cloven earth, knitted by the influence of
                  the councillors, a heaven realized; enemies held fast by concord; on the frontier
                  no hostile venture; in the interior<span class="smaller"> [note 21: Read nang for byang ("north")? [note </span> the yak not beaten(?) – not enough that thus merely the
                  people of Tibet should be enjoying happiness and felicity: in the realms beneath
                  the sun whatever lesser kings there are, uneasy though they were and apprehensive
                  of loss of state, not being lowered in state, are happy. Great kindness such as
                  this having come from the lord [and] councillors, divinely inspired benefactors, a
                  time of universal happiness for the people of Tibet has risen like a sun. Like a
                  flower abloom in the country of the Luck-Summer plain (Bkra shis dbyar mo thang), in the De ga Turquoise-Wood (G.yu
                  tshal), a monstery has been erected by Great Councillor Uncle Khri sum rje and Great Uncle Lha bzang and their subordinates and ourselves and others, and
                  furnished with means for the instalment of a brotherhood; through which
                  benefaction may the lord prince Khri Gtsug lde
                    brtsan be of long life and firm helmet, may great Councillor, Uncle Khri sum rje and Great Uncle Lha bzang attain their purposed ends, may the monastery of the
                  lords councillors of Tibet be imperishable, like the sun, and of firm foundation,
                  and may we ourselves and<span class="smaller"> [note 22: Erased in the
                  original. [note </span> all creatures, cleansed from the darkness of generations, be born
                  in the courts of the supreme god of gods, the Buddha, the holy Maitreya."
              <br>
              From this remarkable record, which by its elevated magniloquence<span class="smaller"> [note 23: The rather frequent occurrence of the word "great" is a noticeable feature of similar oratory elsewhere!] </span> and
                the no less exalted integrity of its sentiment would have done honour to any
                religious foundation, we may derive an enlarged conception of what was possible to
                the Tibetan people, and its language, during their period of greatness. While the
                background is the rigorous intellect of India, we note an accent reminding us that
                dogmatic systems, when planted among fresh peoples, may be capable of a certain
                reflorescence. What, however, more appropriately here attracts our attention is the
                circumstance that the great religious and historic occasion should have been greeted
                by "messages" not merely from princes and ministers, but from cities and local
                bodies. This invites a readjustment of our notions of life in north-eastern Tibet
                and Chinese Turkestan during the eight and ninth centuries A.D.<br>
              The occasion was not the famous concordat whereby the Tibetans and Chinese sought
                to terminate a struggle of nearly (A.D. 783), or more than (A.D. 822), a century and
                a half. An account of those treaties has been given from Chinese sources by <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Bushell_1880: pp. 487 sqq.</a>, and the Lha sa inscriptions relating to them have been published with translations
                and discussions by Col. Waddell. This is not the place for an examination of the
                question whether those treaty inscriptions are two parts of a single document, or
                the question of the Tibetan dynastic lists. What is important for us to note is that
                the Btsan poKhri Gtsug lde btsan Mes 'Ag tshoms, the
                husband of Kim sheng Khon co, whose reign
                extended from A.D. 705-55, and that the treaty was made during his lifetime. Since
                he was definitely the Tibetan king (<span class="bibit">Btsan po</span>) of the time,
                the term lha sras twice (92. A 2, 94. B 2) applied to him must
                have the sense of <span class="bibit">devaputra</span>, "Son of
                Heaven". Of the two ministers, Khri sum
                rje and Lha bzang, named in the
                document, the former must therefore be identified with the Khri sum rje Rtsan bzher frequently mentioned in the Chronicle
                (ll. 147-85, years 44-54 = A.D. 715-25). He was Councillor in A.D. 715, Great
                Councillor in 721, Great Treasurer in 723, and he died in 725.<br>
              Another person mentioned as having initiated a war movement against China is a
                certain "Skam skyel (or dkyel)
                  the Great", also designated <span class="bibit">Thugs skam</span>. In the Lha sa inscriptions (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

              From the dates of the persons concerned it is clear that the treaty in question is
                that concluded in A.D. 730 (Bushell, p. 466), on which occasion were erected
                boundary monuments, including, no doubt, the stone pillar (<span class="bibit">rdo

                and 430 li west of the town of Shihp'u (Bushell, pp. 530-1) – known to the Tibetans (Chronicle, B.M. MS.,

                the G.yar mo sgang of the Geografia Tibeta (p.

                be the birth-place of Tsong kha pa, who was
                born near the Kum bum monastery site. In the
                Chronicle also a Tsong ka is mentioned (l. 74). The fact
                that "messages" are received from the towns of Kwa cu and Mkhar tsan
                illustrates the natural connexion which we have already (p. 72: Ch.75.iii, IOL Tib J

                  Koko-Nor region and that part of Chinese
                Turkestan. The name of the monastery does not transpire; but it is, no doubt, the

                with the Tang-hsiang kingdom, which according to Bushell

                and south of the Koko-nor. We know that this kingdom was
                conquered by the Tibetans in A.D. 678 (Bushell, p. 450), and it is mentioned (ibid.,
                p. 464) in connection with the treaty of A.D. 730. How far the designation 'Jang may have reached, it would be premature to speculate; but
                it has been observed by M. Bacot (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

              The extent of the document may not have been as great as might be indicated by the
                fact that the first surviving folio is numbered 35. But we naturally incline to
                believe that the "messages" from Mdo
                  gams (ll. 88. 1-2) and Bde gams (ll.
                88. 3 sqq.) were preceded at least by one from the Tibetan <span class="bibit">Btsan

              The language of the document, in accord with its literary character, is regular and
                intelligible in a measure quite different from the fragmentary and business records
                with which we have hitherto for the most part been dealing. It presents many
                resembles to the Lha sa inscriptions, which in
                several passages may by its aid be emended and completed. The introductory account

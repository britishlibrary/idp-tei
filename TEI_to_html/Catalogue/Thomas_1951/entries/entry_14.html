                "[ll.2-4] Councillor Rgyal khyi
                  and Councillor Ldong bzang having sent to
                    <span class="bibit">ban de</span>Dpal gyi bzang po for a scripture (<span class="bibit">dar ma</span>), one division, complete with appurtenances<span class="smaller"> [note 4: No doubt, such wraps, labels, and boards as are usual with
                    Tibetan MSS. [note </span>, on behalf of the city of Kwa
                    cu, and that being now with the city, a signature of receipt has not
                  come. The expense also has been already (<span class="bibit">bla</span>) sent.
                  [ll.5-7] Whether a levy has been made or not made by the authorities to meet the
                  expenditure upon material (<span class="bibit">rgyu</span>) and costs (? <span class="bibit">dpya'</span> "tax") (<span class="bibit">chad du bdas sam ma bdas
                  par</span>), we beg to receive a signature, one part, for the expense of material
                    (<span class="bibit">rgyu</span>?). If that is not granted, we beg to receive a
                  signature for at once taking back the scripture and the appurtenances.
              <br>
              
                [ll.8-9] A donation having been undertaken sometime in the Horse year,
                  arising from the previously made communication (?) it appeared that a Tibetan
                    <span class="bibit">Shes rab 'bum pa</span> (<span class="bibit">Śatasāhasrika-Prajñā-pāramitā</span>) in eight divisions, and a Chinese <span class="bibit">'Bum pa</span> in six hundred chapters, three divisions, should be
                  copied. [ll.10-12] In accordance with a previous order to make the expenditure for
                  a Chinese <span class="bibit">'Bum pa</span>, one division, and a Tibetan <span class="bibit">'Bum pa</span>, two divisions, the copying has been done. Upon
                  finger-count in the store of Sha cu, we beg
                  to receive a signature of <span class="bibit">zh[u]ng</span> (acknowledgement?) of
                  the reckoning of the expenditure. [ll.12-15] For the Chinese <span class="bibit">'Bum pa</span>, three divisions, and the Tibetan <span class="bibit">'Bum
                  pa</span>, six divisions, the rations (<span class="bibit">tshal ma</span> = "wages
                  in kind"?) are some four hundred and seventy loads (<span class="bibit">khal</span>)
                  of corn. The donation is some sixty loads. As regards the cost of ink and paper,
                  that not being sent beforehand, it was stated that when the scripture was in
                  existence it should be sent. [ll.15-17] With reference to the difficulty (? <span class="bibit">dka'</span>..?), as the scribes have not obtained their rations,
                  there being no donor, it is right that we should receive forthwith a signature for
                  the expense. This agreed to, we beg to receive a signature, one, for the whole
                  expenditure.
              <br>
              
                [ll. 18-21] The rations for the copying of the Tibetan <span class="bibit">'Bum pa</span>, eight divisions, having after that time by verbal
                  order of some (?)...of the leading men of Sha
                  cu been diminished by half, copyist for the Chinese scripture up to eighty
                  scribes and twenty revisors were sent, the leading men sending a letter to say
                  that what was owing from (to) them should be the rations for copying the Chinese
                  scripture...sent. [ll.21-3] Afterwards, Councillor Khong bzher and the other authorities having entered upon power, we once
                  more beg to receive a signature for obtaining...scribes copying Tibetan
                scripture.
              <br>
              
                [ll.24-25] ...copy a Chinese <span class="bibit">Tshe dpag tu ma mchis

                  been done accordingly, one chapter...sanction the expenditure...
              <br>
              
                [B ll. 1-3] ...at ten, when complete with appurtenances, the measure
                  came to thirteen. The scripture in the possession of the city had volume-extent
                    (<span class="bibit">glegs thag</span> 'volume tie'?) one full fathom. [ll. 3-5]
                  Ten years more having passed, on weighing upon the scales, the volume-extent comes
                  at present to two <span class="bibit">srang</span> and seven <span class="bibit">zho</span>, not reckoning the waste. In regard to reckoning the waste, there were
                  no orders (or 'there is no measure', <span class="bibit">chad</span> or <span class="bibit">tshad ma mchis</span>): we beg to report on the waste (or we beg to
                  report the waste which has not been fixed or deducted). [ll. 5-7] First, where,
                  through injury by worms, there was at the time of weighing unevenness to the hand
                  (or is this = <span class="bibit">lag mdzub mos sbyar nas</span>, 'upon comparison
                  (measuring) with a finger of the hand'?), one <span class="bibit">zho</span> was
                  fixed (deducted); where there was rot from damp, one was fixed (deducted); where
                  from the rotting thirty years, to a good eye, had passed at the time of reckoning,
                  half a <span class="bibit">zho</span> was fixed (deducted). [ll. 7-8] If at a fixed
                  time, after an interval of fifteen days, the rotting had gone on, two <span class="bibit">zho</span> were fixed (deducted).
              <br>
              
                [ll.8-10] Reckoning (note 'the amount fixed or deducted for') those
                  which, since their arrival, had been knocked about, trodden on, and cut and those
                  which had lost more than a full span (measure) of the large finger (note 'one
                    <span class="bibit">zho</span> was fixed or deducted'), for each volume six <span class="bibit">zho</span> were set off as waste. [ll. 10-12] First and last, as the
                    <span class="bibit">sthavira</span>'s of the realm, and the heaven-descended Abbot
                  and the lord chief and the others set off a waste upon a count on a fixed day
                    (<span class="bibit">dam zhags</span>), our humble selves, having received orders
                  restricting us to sending in merely a private representation (<span class="bibit">sgo
                    yus</span>), have discharged our task. [ll. 12-14] Will you have the kindness
                  not to send orders invalidating the instructions of the authorities (<span class="bibit">mngan gyi mchid shags</span>)?
              <br>
              
                [B ll. 15-16] The scripture, two divisions, to be copied in the Horse
                  year having been sent to the Sha cu envoy,
                  the Chinaman, Sheg Tsheng tsheng, a
                  signature of receipt had not come. [ll. 16-17] Afterwards, stating that the
                  scripture had already been paid for, whosoever had been the recipient failed to
                  deliver even a private receipt at the residence of the donor. [ll. 17-19] Four
                  years after it had been completed at Bde
                  gams, <span class="bibit">ban de</span>Khyam zhang, being there on another
                  business, was not able to secure the obtaining of a signature of receipt. [ll.
                  19-21] If the expenditure upon these two divisions of scripture (the divisions
                  having been already counted) is sanctioned, we beg you out of the general expense
                  to send the expense upon them, mentioning the name of Sheg Tsheng tsheng. If the expense is not sanctioned, Tsheng tsheng should return the
                scripture..."

              A l. 2. We translate rkyen (Sk. <span class="bibit">pratyaya</span>)
                as meaning "on behalf of"; but in the next occurrence (B 2) the
                meaning "property" seems more apposite. In effect the latter
                meaning would here yield the same sense.<br>
              l. 3. bul rtags = "receipt": see pp. 17, 19
                (Fragment.66, IOL Tib J 897).<br>
              l. 4. god occurs frequently in these documents (and in others on
                paper and on wood) with the meaning "expenditure or price", which
                is given by the dictionary to <span class="bibit">gong</span>; it usually means "loss".<br>
              l. 5. mngan"the authorities"; see pp. 17, 19 (Fragment.66, IOL Tib J 897).<br>
              chad seems to mean either "sanction payment" or
                actually "pay".<br>
              l. 6. rnam gchig, "one part" or "one instance", seems to be used here, and l. 17 and elsewhere, of part or
                single settlements of accounts. Cf. Vol. I, <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

              l. 7. btsu (from <span class="bibit">'du</span>). The meaning is to
                  "send in", or "call in".<br>
              l. 8. sku yon = "donor", sku
                being an honorific.<br>

              l. 16. dngos, dngos kyis, dngos

              B l. 3. srang = "scales", and also a certain

              This document is clearly a monastery record of work of copying scriptures (dar ma) executed on behalf of outsiders. In the actual instances
                the orders are given, it is interesting to see, on behalf of cities (Kwa cu and Sha
                cu), whether by their actual officials (blon or dpon) or in respect of donations from private persons (sku yon) for their benefit. The texts are either Tibetan or
                Chinese. Scribes are apparently supplied, and their payment is in kind, in rations
                  (tshal ma); the work is carried out under the superintendence of
                the monasteries, which upon completion deliver the volumes and send in their
                accounts.<br>
              We thus see under what conditions the hundreds of copies of certain favorite texts,
                brought by Sir Aurel Stein from the Tun-huang library, may have come into being. The
                next document will supply further particulars of the modus operandi. In the
                meanwhile it is interesting to observe that of the two texts here named, to wit the
                  <span class="bibit">Śata-sāhasrika-Prajñā-pāramitā</span> and the <span class="bibit">Aparimitāyur-dhyāna-nāma-sūtra</span>, the former is represented by very
                numerous fragments and parts and the latter by many bundles of copies in the
                collections.<br>
              In the fifth paragraph (B ll. 1-14) we have a curious record of an inspection of
                the state of the volumes in a city library and an estimate of the damage due to
                worms, damp, and misuse. Mutatis mutandis, one could imagine that it referred not to
                a ninth or tenth century library in Central Asian district on the Chinese frontier,
                but to a modern monastery library in Tibet, or let us say, a library in Europe.<br>

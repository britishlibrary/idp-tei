                "[1-2] On the fourth day of the middle spring month of the Ox year,
                  the prince (<span class="bibit">lha sras</span>) having become an exalted donor in
                  perpetuity, lamp-oil was provided in the monastery(ies) of Sha cu. [2-6] In the monastery Pho kwang si on the evening of the fourth day the god's servant 'Im<span class="smaller"> [note 10: Erased.] </span><br> Dam then
                    'do presented five <span class="bibit">phul</span><span class="smaller"> [note 11: A measure defined as a "handful". [note </span> of <span class="bibit">yu</span> oil, resulting in one hundred portions of lamp-oil. On the
                  evening of the fifth day 'Im<span class="smaller"> [note 12: Erased.] </span><br> Dam then 'do presented five <span class="bibit">phul</span> of <span class="bibit">yu</span> oil, resulting in one hundred portions
                  of lamp-oil. (So on the sixth and tenth days 9 and 4 ½ <span class="bibit">phul</span>, resulting in 180 and 90 lamplights respectively.)
              <br>
              [B 1]...resulting in sixty portions of lamp-oil. Li Kim kang presented seven <span class="bibit">phul</span> of
                    <span class="bibit">yu</span> oil, resulting in one hundred and forty portions of
                  lamp-oil. On the evening of the twenty-eighth day Councillor Gtsug bzher presented seven <span class="bibit">phul</span> and
                  one and a half <span class="bibit">khyor</span>, resulting in one hundred and
                  forty-seven portions of lamp-oil. On the evening of the fifth day of the last
                  winter month Wang Cwan cwan presented seven
                    <span class="bibit">phul</span> of <span class="bibit">yu</span> oil, resulting in one
                  hundred and forty portions of lamp-oil." (The remainder of the document, B ll.
                4-11, reports similar donations by An Zhen tse
                (for Councillor Lho bzang), the God's servant
                  Hag Khi she'u, and Cang Kwang thong.)<br>
              The facts ascertainable from this record of donations to provide illuminations in
                honour of the prince becoming patron of the Sha
                cu monastery seem to be the following: -<br>
              (a) Pho kwang si is a monastery, and the word
                  si (Chinese, as suggested above) may represent, as Professor
                Pelliot has kindly suggested, the Chinese ssŭ"temple".<br>
              (b) lha 'bangs is, no doubt, "god's servant",
                not "king's servant".<br>
              (c) As the number of lamps is consistently proportional to the number of <span class="bibit">phul</span> presented, namely in the proportion of 20 to 1, and as 1 ½
                and 2 <span class="bibit">khyor</span> provide 7 and 10 lamps respectively, it follows
                that 1 <span class="bibit">khyor</span> = ¼ <span class="bibit">phul</span>, which latter
                measure is defined as a "a handful".<br>
              (d)The phrase "with a half two" (phyed dang do)
                means not "two and a half", but "one and a
                half", corresponding to Sanskrit <span class="bibit">ardha-dvitīya</span>, German
                  <span class="bibit">halb-zwei</span>, etc. (and analogously in the case of other
                units).<br>
              The expression "<span class="bibit">yu</span> oil" has not elsewhere
                been found. Probably yu is for <span class="bibit">rgyu</span>"material", so that "<span class="bibit">yu</span>
                oil" would be raw or unpurified oil.<br>

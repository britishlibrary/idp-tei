              (Rev.) Submitted. I, son-brother, Pho
                    tshon wrote this."<br>
              There would be no purpose in a fuller translation of this document, which has been
                selected as showing clearly the system of the nomenclature. It is, as will be seen,
                simply a list of persons, who are alternately designated dgon and
                  'phongs. Most of the persons belong to the "Rgod sar division (<span class="bibit">sde</span>)"; but four are "god's servant" of Pho kwang si and Leng ho si
                respectively, these being, no doubt, the si (probably Chinese
                  ssŭ"temple" of Pho kwang and Leng ho respectively (since we already know Leng
                ho, p. 46 (IOL Tib J 850).<br>
              The red-ink heading in ll. 8-9 shows that what follows is a district list (yul yig) of one tshar, forty persons, belonging
                to the Rgod sar division. But the expressions
                  "right" and "left horn" suggest that it has a
                military significance. There are many indications that the Tibetan military system
                was territorial; and, in fact, we have mention of many regiments bearing the name of
                  districts<span class="smaller"> [note 3: A list of the regiments will be given later
                  (pp. 455 sqq.). On Shud pu see p. 66. Note that not one of
                  the 10 ban des is a 'phongs.] </span>; in consequence the word sde, "district" or "division", has most often to be
                rendered "regiment", and that is, no doubt, the meaning here.
                There are further indications: for besides the "horn" (ru) and its commander (<span class="bibit">ru dpon</span>), which
                occur several times – on the term tshar, "parish", elsewhere evidenced (along with its <span class="bibit">tshar
                dpon</span>), see pp. 169 (M.Tagh.a.iv.0074), 338 (M.I.xii.3, IOL Tib N 520), the dar tshan"silk badge" (<span class="bibit">mtshan</span>) will very likely be
                the banner-bearer: cf. dar, "banner", Vol. I,
                  <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Thomas_1935: pp. 277 sqq</a>. Of the two alternating terms attached
                to most of the names, 'phongs and dgon, the
                former has the sense of "archery", so that the dgon should be the archer's attendant, a sense which, however, does not seem to
                be attested. We have, however, a person's (wooden) "card", which reads Dgon Mon cung, i.e. "Mon
                  cung, a <span class="bibit">dgon</span>" (M.I.vii.88a, IOL Tib N 358).<br>
              Coming now to the nomenclature, we find that most of the names have three
                syllables, of which the first is usually one which recurs and which in several cases
                (e.g. Cang, Dze'u, Li, Ser) we have already encountered. These,
                therefore, are surnames; and, not being for the most part geographical, they are
                clearly clan or tribe names. We have, therefore, in these papers a fair control of
                the ethnographical classification of the region.<br>
              Not to linger over the matter, and reserving any further comments for the combined
                list to be added below, we need here only remark that some of the names such as
                  Shib tig and 'Bye'u tig are clearly Chinese; and it is natural to conjecture that the
                majority are so (perhaps this will be evident to Sinologists). The principal of
                repetition, as in Hwa hwa, Tsheng tsheng, Se'u
                se'u, Kun kun, Ju ju, Kheng kheng, is
                extensively followed, and in other cases the syllable tse seems to
                be in high favour as final element in the names. Concerning Zhi nyang see p. 73 (Ch.75.iii.3, IOL Tib J 1240).<br>

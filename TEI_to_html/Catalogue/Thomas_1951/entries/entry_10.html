              "[ll. 1-2] After that, in the life time of the <span class="bibit">Btsan
                    po</span>Khri Srong rtsan, the Khyung po family was destroyed, only a certain Zu tse being allowed on that day to escape (?). Afterwards
                    Zu tse petitioned in the presence of the
                    <span class="bibit">Btsan po</span>, [ll. 2-4] 'In the lifetime of Gnam ri, the father of the family, called up, I was treated
                  by himself as a subject, forsooth. By the father even I was not even looked at,
                  nor even trampled under his feet (disciplined). By the son <span class="bibit">Btsan
                    po</span> I was regarded with the eye and disciplined. I petitioned. 'Be pleased
                  to invite your aged relative to pleasure, drinking, and feasting in Khri boms.' [l. 5-B l. 1] The <span class="bibit">Btsan po</span>Khri Srong rtsan assented to Zu tse's petition. Following upon that, he sent
                  orders to the palace Ma 'dri ba, holding
                    (<span class="bibit">zung</span>?) the Mgar district.
                  Coming to Zu tse at the city of Khri boms, the Mgar...
                  saw him. Zu tse was attached to the council
                  of that Mgar and was in favour. [B. ll. 1-3] After that,
                  in the lifetime of the <span class="bibit">Btsan po</span>[Khri] Srong rtsan, Myang Zhang snang, a clever man, being outwitted (<span class="bibit">dku 'pel</span> ?) by Zu tse,
                  petitioned in the hearing of the <span class="bibit">Btsan po</span>. Zu tse killed Zhang snang and [remained] in favour.<span class="smaller"> [note 1: Or we
                    might translate "Myang Zhang
                      snang being reported for treachery by Zu
                        tse in the hearing of the Btsan po, Zhang snang was killed...." [note </span> [B
                  ll. 3-4] The chief of To yo chas la, Bor Yong tse, having revolted, Zu tse broughtTo yo chas la and all the rest of northern Zhang zhung under the hand of Khri Srong rtsan and [remained] in favour. [B ll. 4-6]
                  Among the councillors of the <span class="bibit">Btsan po no</span> one before even
                  had ever been more in favour than <span class="bibit">spun sad</span>Zu tse. Zu
                    tse, it was said, is a wise man; he is very cunning and expert; he has a
                  heroic soul; he has much sap (? <span class="bibit">chu gang</span> 'water full' or =
                    <span class="bibit">cu gang</span>); he has a wide outlook (<span class="bibit">yang
                    ba</span> 'expanse' ?); if any single man combines all that is to be combined,
                  it is so with <span class="bibit">spun sad</span>Zu tse."<br>
              l. 1. Khyung po is a clan name; see above, pp. 44
                (Ch.79.xvi.7, IOL Tib J 914), 225 (M.Tagh.b.ii.0033, IOL Tib N 1927), 249
                (M.Tagh.c.ii.0065, Or.15000/243), and Vol. I, <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Thomas_1935: p. 277, n.
                  14</a>. spun sad we have translated as if it were <span class="bibit">˚gsad</span> or <span class="bibit">˚bsad</span>: if that is right, the
                subsequent recurrence of the phrase as an epithet of Zu tse has the sense of "last of his family", or is for
                  <span class="bibit">spun spad</span> = "kinsman"? Rgal"escape" (usually "surmount") is also a
                conjecture. Is nyi ma 'der for <span class="bibit">nyi ma
                lder</span>?<br>
              l. 2. We have taken bdag as "self", not as "I".<br>
              l. 3. Btsan po sras is evidently in contrast to <span class="bibit">(Btsan po) yab</span>.<br>
              l. 4 and 6. Khri boms is mentioned also in the
                Chronicle (l. 35); also in M.Tagh.a.iv.00136 (Or.15000/125), M.Tagh.c.iii.0063 (IOL
                Tib N 2127), and p. 461 (M.Tagh.c.iv.0033, IOL Tib N 2168). <span class="bibit">˚bom(s)</span> (= <span class="bibit">bams</span>) occurs further in 'Go bom below (p. 87: Ch.0021, IOL Tib J 689).<br>
              ll. 5-6. Mgar yul and the palace Ma 'dri ba(?) are not known to me. But in the
                Tibetan <span class="bibit">Me long</span> the famous minister of Srong btsan Sgam po, Gar gdong
                  btsan, is called (fol. 21a.4 30a.5) Mgar, which is,
                no doubt, his tribal name. In the Chronicle we have Mgar Gung ston, etc. (ll. 4, 66, 67, 75), and in the Bstan 'gyur colophons
                  'Gar (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Cordier_1909_1915: I, p. 198</a>,
                etc.).<br>
              B l. 1. glo ba ne"intimate", "in favour", occurs in the Lha sa inscriptions. (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Waddell_1910: p. 1277, l. 22, p.
                1279, ll. 73-4</a>); so also glo ba rings (p. 1276, l. 7, p. 1282, ll.
                59 and 62) and p. 121 (M.I.xix.001, IOL Tib N 785), and pp. 23-4 (IOL Tib J 1253)
                supra and Chronicle, l. 67.<br>
              B l. 2. Myang is a tribal name of frequent occurrence in
                the documents; see p. 305 (M.I.xiv.131.b, IOL Tib N 717 ?; M.Tagh.a.ii.0016, IOL Tib
                N 1494) and the Chronicle, l. 250.<br>
              B l. 3. To yo chas la is not otherwise known to us. Zhang zhung occurs elsewhere as name of Gu ge; and since in Pu 'rangs, which is adjacent to modern Gu
                ge, a place Do yo, or To yo, is actually named (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Francke_1914_1926: II,
                  Index</a>), it is very possible that that locality is here meant.<br>
              B l. 6. tshogs dgu contains dgu in the known
                sense of a plural or a collection.<br>
              Since Gnam ri is the name of the father of
                  Srong btsan Sgam po and also because of the
                ready admission of Zu tse to favour with Khri Srong btsan, it seems probable that Zu tse himself was related to the royal house (cf.
                l. 5). The yab is perhaps the father of Khri Srong btsan, not of Zu
                  tse. The latter is remembered in (<span class="bibit">Bon po</span>)
                literature. Khri Srong rtsan is Srong btsan Sgam po, who in the Lha sa treaty (in <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Waddell_1909: p. 950, l.
                26</a>) is called Khri Lde srong btsan.<br>

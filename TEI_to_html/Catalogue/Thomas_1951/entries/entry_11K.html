              The letter seems to have been written by a lady who had left Mīrān (Nob ched po) for Po
                  gams in Kwa cu. Po gams is unknown, unless it is the Pou-kouang of <a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Chavannes_1913: p. 130</a>; as
                regards the element gams in the name cf. Bde
                gams, etc. From the tenor of the letter the lady would appear to be a
                landowner of Miran who could make presents of water and oil to the Tibetan chief.<br>

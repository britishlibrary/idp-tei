      <p>This catalogue contains two brief articles first published in the <span class="bibit">India Office Library and Records
                            Newsletter</span> in 1988. Both concern two fragments from a single early banknote discovered by M.A. Stein in  Khara-khoto. The first article, by Beth McKillop, discusses the discovery of the banknote and its context in Chinese history. The second, by John Burton, describes how the banknote was preserved by the British Library's Oriental Collections Conservation Studio. </p>

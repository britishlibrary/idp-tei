      <p>This is a collection of transliterations from the Dunhuang manuscripts in the Stein
                and Pelliot collections related to the Chan/Zen tradition. The manuscripts were
                transliterated in a collaboration between the staff of the Songtsen Library under
                the leadership of Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche, and the staff of IDP under the aegis of
                the Tibetan Zen Project (2010–2013), which was funded by the British Academy and led by Sam
                van Schaik. </p>
      <p>The manuscripts have been transliterated into unicode Tibetan
                text, which is best viewed in a browser with the Tibetan Machine Web font installed
                (click <a href="https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/wiki/tibetan-script/Tibet%20Machine%20Web.html" target="_blank">here</a>). The texts have only been lightly edited: insertions are marked
                with brackets [...] and suggested reading with parentheses (...).</p>

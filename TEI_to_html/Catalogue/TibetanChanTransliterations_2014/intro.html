      <p>This is a collection of transliterations from the Dunhuang manuscripts in the Stein
                and Pelliot collections related to the Chan/Zen tradition. The manuscripts were
                transliterated in a collaboration between the staff of the Songtsen Library under
                the leadership of Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche, and the staff of IDP under the aegis of
                the Tibetan Zen Project (2010â€“2013), which was funded by the British Academy and led by Sam
                van Schaik. </p>
      <p>The manuscripts have been transliterated into unicode Tibetan
                text, which is best viewed in a browser with the Tibetan Machine Web font installed
                (click <a href="https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/wiki/tibetan-script/Tibet%20Machine%20Web.html" target="_blank">here</a>). The texts have only been lightly edited: insertions are marked
                with brackets [...] and suggested reading with parentheses (...).</p>

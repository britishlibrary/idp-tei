      <p>This catalogue is based on the classification of the Kharoṣṭhi manuscripts in the British Library collections by Richard Salomon (1999), and incorporates Salomon's measurements of the scrolls. The catalogue numbers correspond to the "Fragment" numbers of Salamon's catalogue, and the "BL" numbers of <a href="http://www.gandhari.org" target="_blank">Gandhari.org</a> and more recent publications. The catalogue numbers relate to the original scrolls, and so may include several of glass frames, each of which has its own British Library pressmark in the Or.14915 sequence. The present catalogue contains direct links to the catalogue and transcriptions on the <a href="http://www.gandhari.org" target="_blank">Gandhari.org</a> website, as well as bibliographical references to works on the manuscripts, and notes on works currently in progress.</p>

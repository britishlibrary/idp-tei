            <span class="bibit">A Summary of the View of Mahāyoga According to Scripture</span><br>
            l.1r: <br>Now, the view of Mahāyoga. What is the view of the
                                five families as a single mode? When the great elements are subsumed
                                into one, they exist in utter perfection. This is the female deity.
                                The forms that come into being from them are the male deity: he who
                                is called Totally Illuminating (Vairocana). As he cannot be carried
                                off by external forces, he is known as The Immoveable (Akṣobya). As
                                he fulfills all wishes, he is known as The Jewel-Born
                                (Ratnasambhava). As he goes to the realms of light he is known as
                                Limitless Light (Amitābha). l.1v: <br> As ... he is known as
                                Meaningful Accomplishment (Amoghasiddhi). The five families are, in
                                this way, a single mode.<br> What are the relevant samaya? One should gather the samaya in order
                                to embrace that which is concordant, in order to restrain that which
                                is discordant, and in order to obtain and accomplish. The 28 samaya
                                are the transmitted precepts. According to the esoteric instructions
                                these are grouped into three. This one should know. What are they?
                                They are: <br> (i) The samaya of view.<br> (ii) The samaya of practice.<br>(iii) The samaya of accomplishment.<br> Now to distinguish these. The samaya of mind (not disseminating the
                                secret instruction to others) and the five aspects to be known, are
                                the samaya of the view. The samaya of the body (not developing
                                ill-will or scorn towards the vajra master and brothers and sisters)
                                and the five samaya to be practised, and the five samaya not to be
                                renounced, are the samaya of practice. The samaya of speech (not
                                ceasing in the mantras and mudrās) and the five samaya to be
                                accomplished, are the samaya of accomplishment. l.2r: <br> The
                                unsurpassable fruit of these three is the nature of
                                accomplishment.<br>The union of Mahāyoga is called "the union of the vajra and the
                                lotus." It is also threefold: <br>(i) The union in the single ornament.<br>(ii) The union of the five families in a single mode.<br>(iii) Indiscriminate union.<br>One should know that each of these has four parts:<br>(i) Union.<br>(ii) Subsequent union.<br>(iii) Total union.<br>(iv) Universal union. <br> Of these, meditating on oneself as the deity is union. Subsequent
                                union is developing the wisdom being at one's heart. Total union is
                                the unshakeable great bliss of the descent of the bodhicitta of the
                                union of vajra and lotus. Universal union is projection and
                                absorption, conferring empowerment upon limitless sentient beings,
                                each in their particular deity family. l.2v: <br><br>When [practising] union in Mahāyoga, the qualities of greatness are
                                said to be: <br>(i) Subduing the four Māras<br>. (ii) Playing with the five space
                                mistresses. <br>(iii) Possessing the four secret consorts.<br>The four Māras are:<br>(i) Māra the aggregates.<br>(ii) Māra the afflications.<br>(iii) Māra the god.<br>(iv) Māra the lord of death.<br>Of these, the phase of meditation on the mahāmudrā of the deity's
                                body is called conquering Māra the aggregates. The phase of the
                                unshakeable great bliss of bodhicitta is called conquering Māra the
                                afflictions because the mind of the three times does not arise. The
                                phase of acting for the benefit of sentient beings is called
                                conquering Māra the god. The phase of experiencing the savour of
                                bodhicitta, which transcends birth and death, is called conquering
                                Māra the lord of death. <br>l.3r: <br> The five space mistresses are:<br>(i) The vajra space mistress.<br>(ii) The lotus space mistress.<br>(iii) The jewel space mistress.<br>(iv) The karma space mistress.<br>(v) The airborne space mistress.<br> Of these, the male is called the vajra space mistress and the female
                                is called the lotus space mistress. The phase of unshakeable great
                                bliss which is the descent of bodhicitta endowed with the vajra and
                                the lotus is called the jewel space mistress. The phase of activity
                                for the benefit of sentient beings [by] projecting and absorbing the
                                bodhicitta is called the karma space mistress. And thus making all
                                bodhicitta of one taste without it bursting out is called the
                                airborne space mistress. <br>The four secret consorts are:<br>(i) The Lady of Mudrā.<br>(ii) The Lady of Intoxication.<br> (iii) The Lady of Eating.<br>
                            (iv) The Lady who Prolongs Life.<br>
                            Of these, the body of the consort is known as the Lady of Mudrā. The
                                unshakeable great bliss of bodhicitta is known as the Lady of
                                Intoxication l.3v: <br>. Experiencing the savour as
                                bodhicitta, or alternatively accepting and eating, is known as the
                                Lady of Eating. The phase of obtaining the praiseworthy qualities of
                                bodhicitta is known as the Lady who Prolongs Life because it
                                transcends birth and death.<br>
                            The liberation of Mahāyoga is said to comprise: <br>
                            (i) Liberation of oneself.<br>
                            (ii) Liberation of others.<br>
                            Of these, liberation of oneself comprises:<br>
                             (i) Approaching the deity.<br>
                            (ii) Clarifying the tantras.<br>
                             Of these, in approaching the deity the measure of accomplishment is
                                the ability to levitate up to four finger-widths. And clarifying the
                                tantras means becoming learned in the eighteen tantras, or
                                alternatively it indicates the sages who possess the transmitted
                                precepts and esoteric instructions. The liberation of others means
                                that having assembled many such great lords, those in the category
                                of the ten fields are placed into the maṇḍala of the heroes. Within
                                the circle they are liberated to bring them into accord with
                                others.<br>
                             Meditation, via the gradual development of the three aspects of
                                Mahāyoga, is as follows: l.4r: <br><br>
                            (i) One begins with meditation on the dharmatā.<br>
                            (ii) One then meditates on the unassailable total illumination.<br>
                             (iii) One then meditates on the causal concentration.<br>

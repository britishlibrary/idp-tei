      <p>"A Summary of the View of Mahāyoga According to Scripture" is substantially the
                longest and most detailed definition of Mahāyoga provided in any of the Dunhuang
                manuscripts. Thus it is one of the most important texts for our understanding of the
                tantric system of Mahāyoga, as it was practised in the 9th and 10th centuries. It is
                found in a single Tibetan manuscript, IOL Tib J 436, which is poorly written and
                physically damaged, and the text is probably missing its opening lines. The Summary
                treats Mahāyoga under four headings: (i) view, (ii) samaya, (iii) union and
                liberation, and (iv) meditation.</p>
      <p>This text comes from a time when Mahāyoga was considered the pinnacle of tantric
                ritual practice, while it was simulataneously in the process of being displaced from
                that position by the developing rubrics of Anuyoga and Atiyoga. At this point the
                latter (Anuyoga and Atiyoga) seem to have been primarily view or theory-based
                approaches, with little or no ritual presence in the manuscripts. Toward the end of
                this period we see a movement towards the stratification of the tantric categories
                of Mahāyoga, Anuyoga and Atiyoga. That trend is best represented in doxographical
                texts and – for Mahāyoga – the central text of this survey, The Summary of the View
                of Mahāyoga According to Scripture.</p>
      <p>Based on the Summary we may offer the following brief definition of Mahāyoga in 10th
                century Tibet:</p>
      <p>1. The theoretical content or view is defined as the ‘single mode’ (tshul gcig) in
                which the buddhas of the five families are embodied in a single deity, usually
                Vajrasattva.</p>
      <p>2. Meditation is defined by the gradual visualization practice of of the three
                concentrations (ting nge 'dzin). These are the concentrations on (i) suchness, (ii)
                total illumination, and (iii) the cause.</p>
      <p> 3. Ritual practice is subsumed by the two categories of union and liberation (sbyor
                sgrol), that is, sexual practice with a consort and ritual murder. The Summary
                leaves some room for interpreting these practices metaphorically.</p>
      <p> 4. The samaya vows (dam tshig) that bind a practitioner who has received a Mahāyoga
                empowerment comprise three root and twenty-five branch vows.</p>
      <p> 5. The result of Mahāyoga practice is defined in a succession of four levels of
                accomplishment known as the four kinds of vidyādhara (rigs 'dzin).</p>
      <p> 6. The scriptural group associated with Mahāyoga is the ‘eighteen tantras’, although
                the content of this group is uncertain.</p>
      <p>In the transcription, that follows the translation, I have attempted to provide a
                clear reading of the manuscript without over-correcting the archaic orthography. In
                most cases the divergences from classical orthography (eg. <span class="bibit">rin cen</span>,
                    <span class="bibit">dam tsig</span>) are self-explanatory. I have made a very few insertions
                (marked by square brackets) where these seemed necessary to make the reading more
                clear.</p>

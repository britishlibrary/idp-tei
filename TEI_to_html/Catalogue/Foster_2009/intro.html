      <p>The original manuscript of the Classic of Go <span class="smaller">[note 1: The Chinese name for the game is weiqi, the first character of the title is a variant of qi, pronounced go in Japan. Since most English speakers familiar with the game have studied it with Japanese terminology, for the sake of clarity, I use Go instead of weiqi, and try to apply the appropriate Japanese terms where applicable.]</span> is labeled Or.8210/S.5574 (“S” for Stein) and is thought to be the oldest extant manual devoted to the game of Go. In the 1960s, Cheng Enyuan provided a modern simplified Chinese transcription with copious notes. It is his opinion that the manuscript was written in the sixth century A.D., in the state of Northern Zhou, due to the structure of some of the characters and language used.<span class="smaller">[note 2: One key being that black pieces are not called “black pieces” 黑子, but “raven pieces” 烏子. Cheng found that “black” was part of the childhood name of one of the Northern Zhou emperors. Traditionally, one cannot use a character in an emperors name out of respect, and so must substitute another character for that which is to be avoided. In Northern Zhou, “Black River” and “Black Peak” were referred to as “Raven River” and “Raven Peak” to avoid the taboo character “black.” Cheng Enyuan, Dunhuang Qi Jing Jian Zheng [An Examination of The Dunhuang "Classic of Go"] Chengdu : Shu Rong qi yi chu ban she : Sichuan sheng xin hua shu dian fa xing, 1990), 95.]</span>  A revised edition of Cheng’s work was published in 1990. A transcription of the manuscript into modern complex Chinese characters is available on the internet site of Hong Kong’s CCC Yenjing College Go Club.<span class="smaller">[note 3: Anonymous, "敦煌棋經," CCC Yenching College, http://go.yenching.edu.hk/dh_txt1.htm.]</span></p>

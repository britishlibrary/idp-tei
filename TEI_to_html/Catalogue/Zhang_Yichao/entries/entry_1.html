              ... The mounted troops of the Tibetans from the Sichuan area were returning to sack Sha Zhou. Spies who had obtained information about their movements, without stopping to rest at night, came to report to the Secretary for State Affairs: 'The King of the Tuyughun is gathering together the barbarian bandits from the Sichuan area and is intent upon coming here to invade and pillage. As of today, however, the Tibetans have not yet all assembled.'<br>
              When the Secretary for State Affairs heard that the King of the Tuyughun had rebelled, he immediately mustered his troops. The army went out of the city through the gate of death, then advanced via forced march towards the southwest.<br>
              After having spent but two nights on the road, they soon arrived in the vicinity of West Paulownia, where they intended to join battle with the enemy. The bandits ran away immediately, not daring to put up any resistance. The Secretary for State Affairs then signalled his three armies that they must pursue them. After a march of more than three hundred and fifty miles which took them all the way to the Kingdom of the Tuyughun, they finally caught up with the bandits.<br>
              The Secretary for State Affairs immediately ordered his troops to dress their ranks and make ready their weapons. They unfurled their flags and pennants, they beat their lizard-skin drums. The eight formations were executed, brave heroes went galloping by. The troops were divided into two striking-forces so as to envelop the enemy on all four sides. The men grasped their naked swords, the sallying cavalry vied to be first. Within moments, the formation closed like a dark mist spreading over the sky. The Chinese armies valiantly took the initiative. Dragging their spears behind them, they rushed over the hills and advanced directly.<br>
              This is the place where the cowardly barbarian tribes flee north and south and where one hundred men of the heroic Chinese General stand against a thousand of the enemy: Suddenly, it was heard that the barbarian dogs had begun to, show their savagery, That they had revolted at West Paulownia and held a strategic forest. Troops were deployed to hurry there on a beeline through the starry night, They were under orders that this time, no matter how, they must apprehend the foe; The heroic Field Marshal had plans plentiful as raindrops, Against them, to what would the schemes of the stupid barbarian tribes amount?<br>
              For ten years, lances raised, they had kept the vile rogues at bay, On the three frontiers, the fierce and the violent were unable to invade; Who would have thought that this year they would wreak any havoc? -Abruptly, and according to precedent, their rebelliousness began to show itself.<br>
              Now it was necessary, no matter how, to display the thieves' heads on high poles, Swiftly, the mist-like armies closed in, wave upon dense wave; With these words, the General issued orders to his men: 'Persevere! Do not shirk the toil of a hundred battles! [115] The reputation and rank of men of spirit are to be found in the tip of a spear,In confronting the enemy, you must not flee from his sword!' The Chinese grasped their swords which glinted like frost and snow, The savage horsemen had nowhere to flee under the broad heavens; Heads struck by sword and lance tips were piled up on mounds of earth, Blood splattered from the barbarian corpses soaked through battle tunics. After one skirmish, the Tuyughun were almost entirely defeated, The Field Marshal approached sternly and with rising fury.<br>
              In this one decisive battle, the barbarian armies suffered a great defeat. The King of the Tuyughun was terror-stricken. Breaking through the encirclement, he fled. He ascended a high mountain and took control of a dangerous defile. His three chief ministers, at that very moment, were being captured alive at the head of the formation. They were unceremoniously executed in front of the horses according to the military code.<br>
              More than three hundred captives, including women and children, were taken alive. Two thousand head of camels, horses, cattle, and sheep were seized. Then they returned to their camp singing 'Big Battle Music'.<br>
              Three hundred and fifty miles north of Dunhuang was Lapchuk District Town, a strategically important location west of the walled city of Hami. At that time, the Uighurs and the Tuyughun had settled there and frequently came to Hami to pillage. They captured the people and their belongings, forcibly seized their herds, and left them without a moment's peace. On July 11, 856, the Secretary for State Affairs personally organized armoured troops and went there to attack and drive them away.<br>
              In less than ten days, they reached the town of Lapchuk. The bandits had not expected that the Chinese troops would arrive so suddenly and were totally unprepared. Our armies proceeded to line up in a 'black-cloud formation', swiftly striking from all four sides. The barbarian bandits were panic-stricken. Like stars they splintered, north and south. The Chinese armies having gained the advantage, they pursued them, pressing close at their backs. Within fifteen miles, they caught up with them.This is the place where their slain corpses were strewn everywhere across the plain:<br>
              The Field Marshal from Dunhuang was a Chinese feudal lord,He cast out the western barbarians and paid court at the Phoenix Tower; The Divine Ruler had commissioned him to govern the land in the west, But the Turkish tribes were utterly antagonistic. He had recently heard that the Huns were invading the town of Hami, They plundered and captured the frontier people making them anxious day and night; The Commander-in-Chief shouted angrily and arched his eyebrows in indignation, Right away, he marched his soldiers off on a distant mission of retrieval.<br>
              When the two armies saw each other, it was like dragons fighting, The blood even flowed west of the town of Lapchuk; [116] Our general's triumphant manner embodied grace and martial prowess, He so intimidated the barbarian louts that they lost all courage; No sooner had the dog barbarians seen that the Tang armies were victorious, Than their retreating troops scattered like stars as they deserted their posts. Having come so far, today the Chinese troops would have to slaughter the foe, They pressed close at their backs and seized them, unwilling to desist; A thousand men were struck by arrows and perished on the battlefield, With razor-sharp blades, they slashed and sliced, lopping off the heads of the bandits.<br>
              Fluttering red flags gleamed as brightly as the sun, And would not have been shamed by Tian Dan when he let loose his fiery cattle; The divine aid of the ruler of China prevailed throughout, They exterminated the desperadoes, sparing none at all.<br>
              In this decisive battle between the Secretary for State Affairs and the dog barbarians, the Uighurs were badly beaten. Flustered, each of them abandoned his saddled horse and ran inside the city wall of Lapchuk which they held securely. Thereupon, the central armies raised their decorated horns and, with a great clashing sound, made a series of attacks. Troops were set in ambush on all four sides. They seized ten thousand head of camels, horses, and the like. Our armies gained a great victory, not having lost a single mount.<br>
              They proceeded at once to regroup and, heading for Sha Zhou, they returned. After they arrived at their base, they fed their horses every morning and drilled their troops every day. In order to be prepared for the Huns, there was never even a moment's respite.<br>
              Previously, in the tenth year of the Da Zhong reign-period (856), the Great Tang government had deputed the Secretary of the Board of Censors, Wang Ruizhang, as an ambassador to confer recognition upon the Uighurs. Bearing his credentials, he had journeyed to the Khanate. Below him was the peon, Chen Yuanhong. Now, as he ran inside the boundary of Sha Zhou, he was spotted by the border-guard, Zuo Chengzhen.<br>
              Suddenly, in the middle of the wilderness, Chengzhen unexpectedly encountered a man who was racing along wildly. So he charged his assistants to bring the man in front of his horse and began immediately to interrogate him. Chen Yuanhong stepped forward in front of him and declared: 'While serving on a mission to confer recognition, I was ordered by the Chinese court to go north and enter Uighur territory. We had gone as far as the southern slopes of the Snowy Mountains when our State documents were wrested from us by mutinous Uighurs. So each of us fled, running wherever, his feet led him. Thus have I come to this place - I am not an unfriendly person. I humbly look to you, General, and hope that you will extend your kind consideration.'<br>
              Having learned that he was an envoy of the Chinese court, Chengzhen gave him a horse to carry him to Sha Zhou. There he was conducted in to an interview with the Secretary for State Affairs. Chen Yuanhong kneeled to him in obeisance and paid his respects. Standing in front of the tent, he stated in full the reasons for his being there.<br>
              The Secretary for State Affairs asked Chen Yuanhong: 'Where did you meet the bandits? And who was the chief of your mission?'<br>
              Chen Yuanhong stepped forward and addressed the Secretary for State Affairs: 'The chief of my mission was Wang Ruizhang. He had received imperial orders to go north and enter the Khanate bearing his credentials as an envoy to confer recognition. We had gone as far as the southern slopes of the Snowy Mountains when we came across a thousand and more rebellious Uighur horsemen. We were at once robbed of our state documents of appointment and various letters patent. The others and I had come out from the capital, never having had any familiarity with field operations. [117] They were many and we were few. As a result, we succumbed to their villainous trickery.'<br>
              When the Secretary for State Affairs heard this, his heart was filled with a great rage. 'How dare these bandits be so brazenly seditious that they recklessly engage in wanton destruction!' Then he turned to Chen Yuanhong and told him: You may go back to the public hostel where you will be provided with rations.'<br>
              In the interval before the troops set out, on August 27, 857, the Prefect of Hami, Wang Heqing, dispatched a messenger on horseback. When he arrived at Sha Zhou, he said: 'There are five hundred and more tent-units of Uighurs whose leaders are the Military-Governor Di and others. The Uighur people whom they lead have already reached the vicinity of Hami...'<br>

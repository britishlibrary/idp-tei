      <p>This catalogue consists of the catalogue compiled by the India Office Librarian FW Thomas on paper slips. The catalogue concerns the Tibetan material from Stein's third expedition, largely manuscripts and printed material from the sites of Karakhoto and Etsingol. This catalogue has never previously been published.</p>
      <p>Maho IUCHI input the text of Thomas's catalogue slips into a computer file. Eva del Rey and Marta Matko marked up the text. Marta Matko edited the XML document, assigned the correct shelfmarks and checked inconsistencies against the original manuscripts.</p>

              Part of juan 15 of the<span class="bibit">Huayanjing lun</span>(see MS 2b). 25 lines of text (此處是第三 to 說爾時如來). MS 2c seems to be
                                unique in transmitting this part of theHuayanjing lun, a work originally in 100 juan, only one
                                of which (juan 10) is preserved in the Zoku Zōkyō (Z sec.1, vol.93,
                                pp.468b-472b). S.3987 and possibly S.3986 transmit other fragments
                                of the same work. The text is part of the introduction to the
                                commentary to T no.278, vol. 9, p. 441b.5-441c.19.<br>

      <p>The Dunhuang manuscripts in the Royal Library of Copenhagen were donated by Arthur
                Bollerup Sørensen (1880–1932) on 29 November 1915. The Dunhuang collection of the
                Royal Library of Copenhagen consists of 16 manuscripts in 14 rolls. Except for one
                Daoist scripture, the manuscripts are Buddhist. The text of MS 2c seems to have been
                transmitted nowhere else but this collection. MSS 12 and 16 present texts
                transmitted only in the form of Dunhuang manuscripts in other collections. Both of
                these are of special interest as they are supplied with colophons.</p>

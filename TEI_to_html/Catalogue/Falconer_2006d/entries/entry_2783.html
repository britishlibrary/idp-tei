              General view of site, with river beyond. Innermost Asia, vol. 1, fig. 70: 'Ruins near Jangal-gumbaz, above Tash-kurghan River.' (I.A. Map 3, C1). The site was not surveyed in detail by Stein: 'Owing to the late hour I was unable to examine it closely; but during my busy day at Tash-kurghan I had a plan and photograph of it taken by Surveyor Afraz-gul.' (i, 57).<br>

              Innermost Asia, vol. 1, fig. 53: 'Glacier pushed across Karambar River below Shuiyenj.' 'About eight miles below the pass, the valley contracts below the last grazing grounds of Shuiyenj. Beyond this the track led past the snout of a large glacier on the south, which has piled its ice against the rocky slopes opposite. The river thus blocked had cut its way in a big tunnel below it.' (i, 50).<br>

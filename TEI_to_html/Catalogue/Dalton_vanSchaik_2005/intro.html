      <p>This is a complete catalogue covering all of the Tibetan tantric manuscripts in the British Library's Dunhuang collections.</p>
      <p>The catalogue is the result of a collaboration between IDP and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), funded by the Arts and Humanities Resource Council (AHRC). The project was overseen by Ulrich Pagel (Head of the Department of the Study of Religions, SOAS), Burkhard Quessel (Curator of Tibetan materials at the British Library) and Susan Whitfield (Director of IDP). The cataloguing work was carried out between August 2002 and August 2005.</p>

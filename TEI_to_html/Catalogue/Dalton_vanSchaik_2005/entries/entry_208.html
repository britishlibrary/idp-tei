This manuscript is a sheet (probably originally a scroll) which has been folded down its length. The original recto of the scroll, containing Chinese text, has been folded inside, and the outer part has been used to write the Tibetan document. The other part of this manuscript is in the Pelliot collection: 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_320A:

                false;">PT_320B:

                false;">PT_320B:

is not directly related to this one. There is probably a lacuna between the end of 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

this manuscript.

This is a 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
of 

Avalokiteśvara

which would probably fall into the category of the 
<span class="bibit">
Yoga tantra
</span>
s. It seems to belong to the same group as the 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
found in 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_331</a>
and the 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
found in a manuscript split between the Stein and Pelliot collections: 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ITJ_583/2</a>
and 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_288:

</a>
. This version of the 
<span class="bibit">

</span>
is lacking the description of the 
<span class="bibit">

<br>
              
The extant text starts on 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_320A: 
recto
</a>
, although the original beginning of the manuscript seems to be lost. By comparison with the other 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
s mentioned above, we can see that this manuscript comes in at the point where the three syllables are visualized: an 

Ōṃ

at the crown of the head, an 

Aṃ

at the throat and a 

Hūng

at the heart. This visualization establishes the emptiness of self and phenomena. Then the celestial palace is established on a sun disc from the syllable 

phrung. Then on a moon disc from the syllable 

Hri

the meditator appears as 

Avalokiteśvara

, with a white body. The deity's accoutrements are described here in more detail than in the other versions of the 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
: he wears a "lion robe" (seng gos) with gold tracery, and a 

ba hi

skirt. He wears a crown (dbu rgyan), armlets (dpung rgyan), a necklace (se mo do) and earrings (snyan ca). This is the end of 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_320A: 
recto.
</a><br>
              
The following section of the text appears in this manuscript. 

Avalokiteśvara

is sitting cross-legged on the lotus, with the three syllables mentioned earlier at his three places. Binding the 
<span class="bibit">
samayamūdra
</span>
, one recites the root mantra (not given here, but see 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ITJ_583/2</a>
), and the 
<span class="bibit">
jñānasattva
</span>
appears, making the meditator one with space (dbyings) and identical with 

Avalokiteśvara

's 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
body, speech and mind. At this point, this manuscript comes to an end, and the rest of the text appears on 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_320B:

</a>
.
<br>
              
The meditator develops great pride in the identity with the deity. At his heart is a moon disc upon which is the mantra garland. The is to be recited 1008 times or more, along with "the three suchnesses" (de kho na nyid gsum). The final part of the practice is introduced with the phrase "If you wish to dismiss..." (gtong bar 'dod na). The same phrase appears in 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ITJ_583: 
Rf.5v.3-4
</a>
. The following practice is also described in general terms similar to the other text, although here there is a further conclusion to the meditation. The meditator is very briefly instructed to invite the deities, do the 
<span class="bibit">
mūdra
</span>
s, venerate them with the songs and dances, and do the confession and aspirational prayer. Then the deity and celestial palace dissolve into light and into the meditator's body, and he meditates without conceptualization. Finally, the meditator is enjoined to develop the deity by remembering the syllable, to protect the body with the 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
and 
<span class="bibit">
mūdra
</span>
s. The text ends with a mantra: 

Oṃ ba dzra yag sha kro dha khā dha khā dha hūng phat.

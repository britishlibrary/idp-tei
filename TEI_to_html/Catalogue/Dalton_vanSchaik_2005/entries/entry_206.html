                false;">PT_353</a>
introduces the text as an explication of the "natural 
<span class="bibit">

</span>
" (rang bzhin gyi dkyil 'khor), which is a member of the set of three 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
s discussed in the 
<span class="bibit">

</span>
treatise,

</a>
. In fact, the text seems to describe two 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
s. The introduction goes on to state that the teaching on the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is taken from "the tantras of the secret mantra and the 
<span class="bibit">
sūtras
</span><a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

<span class="bibit">

</span>
'I mdo).
<br>
              
The 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
opens with a section on the way in which the 
<span class="bibit">
dharmakāya
</span>
pervades all beings (and here one may detect some affinity with early Great Perfection (
<span class="bibit">
rdzogs chen
</span>
) literature), followed by a section on compassion, which is followed by a self- visualization as a wisdom being (
<span class="bibit">
ye shes sems dpa'
</span>
). This seems to be following the three 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
structure found in many 
<span class="bibit">
Mahāyoga
</span><span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
s.
<br>
              
The description of the first 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
begins on the third folio of the text, which is the first folio of the present 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ITJ_507</a>
. At each of the five directions, a 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
is visualized: a mile-long hundred spoked 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
in the centre, a nine-spoked 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
in the east, a five-spoked 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
in the south, a one-spoked 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
in the west and a three-spoked 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
in the north. The other four deities of the five families appear next to the 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
s. Then the consort, described as a female wisdom being (
<span class="bibit">
ye shes sems ma
</span>
), appears and summons further goddesses, including 

Ekajāti

. The latter extols the virtues of herself and the female wisdom being. This leads in to the section on the visualization of the second 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
(

(6r.8

). The 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is a concentric series of lotuses and a wheel of 32 spokes, with the female wisdom being at the centre. The 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is populated by over a hundred female deities; the exact number is difficult to determine, though it may be 108. 

Ekajāti

is said to pervade the entire 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. The text closes with a speech from the lord of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
, who refers to this 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
as "the great lotus 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
" (

9r.4

pad mo'i dkyil 'khor ched po). He also calls the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
set out earlier in the text "the joyful expanse 
<span class="bibit">

</span>
" (

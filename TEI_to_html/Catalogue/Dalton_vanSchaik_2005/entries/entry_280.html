A short tantric treatise containing two discussions, first a doxography of the Buddhist vehicles (Tib. 
<span class="bibit">
theg pa
</span>
, Skt. 
<span class="bibit">
yāna
</span>
), and second a presentation of the different levels of 
<span class="bibit">
vidyādhara
</span>
that can be attained. The first discussion presents a system of nine vehicles (
<span class="bibit">
theg pa dgu
</span>
) that is almost identical to the well known system adopted by the 
<span class="bibit">
Rnying ma
</span>
school. Along with the 
<span class="bibit">
Dgongs pa 'dus pa'i mdo
</span>
(
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">NGB_373</a>
), this manuscript is one of the earliest examples of this system, though alternative nine vehicles systems are found in other works from the same period (see for example 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_849</a>
). Each vehicle is described using the following set of criteria: the deity lineage which is focused upon (lha rgyud), the central difference (khyad bar), and the measure of accomplishment (grub tshad). 
<br>
              
The second discussion organizes the various kinds of 
<span class="bibit">
vidyādhara
</span>
s according to the tantric vehicle with which they correspond. In the context of the second of three kinds of 
<span class="bibit">
vidyādhara
</span>
associated with 
<span class="bibit">
Kriyā tantra
</span>
, namely the 
<span class="bibit">
vidyādhara
</span>
of dwelling on the levels (sa la gnas pa'i rigs 'dzin), a story is told about an unnamed figure going to an 

Asura Cave

to meditate:
<br>
            <br>
             (
2r.6
)

             (

) 
Then 

Vajrapāṇi

arrived and granted the 
<span class="bibit">
siddhi
</span>
s. Then he went to the 

Asura Cave

, and then, upon beholding the visage of an emanation of 

Vajrapāṇi

present there, he struck the rock with his foot. It seemed as if he had stuck it into dough. From that footprint descended the 
<span class="bibit">
samaya
</span>
, whereupon there came from within a spring with eight branches. One flowed to the south face of Mt. 

Sumeru

, so the spring was called the 

Aśvakarṇa

(

rta rna

). Seven of them fell inside of the 

Asura Cave

. In them he cleansed himself and became accomplished. Thus he was called a 
<span class="bibit">
vidyādhara
</span>
who dwells on the levels.

At the bottom of folios

3v

is found some faded writing which does not seem to be part of the main text. The last folio side attributes the translation of two well known tantras as follows:

            <br>
             (
3v.1
)

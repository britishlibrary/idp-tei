This fragment of a scroll contains a work, or a sequence of works on 
<span class="bibit">
Mahāyoga
</span>
. At least one, and possibly all of the texts deal with the 
<span class="bibit">
Guhyasamāja-tantra
</span>
(Tib. 
<span class="bibit">
Gsang ba 'dus pa'i rgyud
</span>
, 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">P_81</a>
, 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ITJ_438</a>
). The first section is badly damaged, and only the end of the discussion is legible. It deals with the topic of making offerings in the context of the secret mantra (
<span class="bibit">
gsang sngags
</span>
).
<br>
              
The second section (

8

) sets out the significance of the syllables e, bam, ma and ya (evam mayā: the standard scriptural opening syllables which begin the 
<span class="bibit">
Guhyasamāja-tantra
</span>
).
<br>
              
The third section (

11

) is a discussion of the title of the tantra, in terms of the first part 
<span class="bibit">
guhya
</span>
(Tib. 
<span class="bibit">
gsang ba)
</span>
and then the second part 
<span class="bibit">
samāja
</span>
(Tib. 
<span class="bibit">
'dus pa
</span>
). This section mentions the translators of this tantra or of tantras in general, using the terms 

bsgyur ba'i mkhan po

and 

lo tsa pa, possibly implying a Tibetan authorship for the present treatise.
<br>
              
The fourth section (

27

) briefly divides the tantra into five sections, as follows: (i) entering the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
, (ii) the blessings, (iii) giving the 
<span class="bibit">
samaya
</span>
, (iv) the initiation,(v) teaching the rules. Another form of the five section division follows this one: (i) the setting, (ii) the conversation, (iii) ...full understanding, (iv) how to understand, (v) teaching the reality (
<span class="bibit">
dngos po
</span>
) of the tantra.
<br>
              
The fifth section (

32

) is fragmentary, and would have continued on to the next, missing scroll panel. At the beginning it mentions a master (
<span class="bibit">
slob dpon
</span>
) called 

Ma du san du

, probably a transcription of a Sanskrit name. The role of this figure is not clear; he may be meant to be the author of this commentary, an earlier figure in the the exegetical lineage, or even the redactor of the tantra. The text mentions four 
<span class="bibit">
yoga
</span>
s and four 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
s and enumerates four great accumulations (tshogs chen po). There seems to be a connection here with 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ITJ_454</a>
, which also discusses these sets of four, in much more detail. A further passage (

41

) asserts that these sets of four were not fabricated by the master (referring to 

Ma du san du

?) but were taken from oral sources (zhal nas gsung). The text moves on to discuss which buddha spoke the words of the tantra. The question is deflected with the assertion that there is no buddha other than one's own mind. Two 
<span class="bibit">
Mahāyoga
</span>
tantras are quoted to this effect: the 

Dbang chen bsdus pa

(
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Tb_595</a>
) and the 

Dpal mchog dang po

(
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Tb_412</a>
). The fragment ends in the middle of the second quotation.

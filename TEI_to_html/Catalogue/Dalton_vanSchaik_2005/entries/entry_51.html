A 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
for generating a 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
of wrathful deities. In its opening lines, the work associates itself with the 
<span class="bibit">
Māyājāla
</span>
(Tib. 
<span class="bibit">
sgyu 'phrul dra ba
</span>
) tantras, recommending that the reader cultivate the deity yoga in accordance with that system. Thus we can safely classify the work as 
<span class="bibit">
Mahāyoga
</span>
. Furthermore, the central tantra from the 
<span class="bibit">
Māyājāla
</span>
series, the 
<span class="bibit">
Guhyagarbha -tantra
</span>
(Tib. 
<span class="bibit">
gsang ba'i snying po
</span>
), is cited several times as a source for the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
description (compare, for example, 3r.1-2 to 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">NGB_417:

</a>
or 4v.6-7 to 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">NGB_417: 
199.4-6
</a>
). These passages are not exactly the same as the corresponding passages in the canonical tantra, nor are they cited in sequential order. Furthermore, there seems to be at least one other text being quoted as a source for the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
descriptions. Unfortunately, at no point is a title provided for any of the quoted passages. It is also somewhat difficult to determine where the quotations finish, as no markers (like the standard 

zhes) are used. Most quotations are marked at their beginnings with the refrain, "de la 'di skad ces brjod par bya'o", though even that is not always provided.
<br>
              
The 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
itself has at its center the 
<span class="bibit">
heruka
</span>
of the 
<span class="bibit">
tathāgata
</span>
family, with the 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
family in the eastern direction. According to Eastman, the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
resembles that found in two fragments of a 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
painted on paper from Stein collection in the National Museum in New Delhi (see 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Eastman_1983:

</a>
). In the same article, Eastman points out that the term used on 

1b.6

, 

no pyi ka, is common in the Dunhuang literature but rare elsewhere, and it is glossed in 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_849</a>
as 
<span class="bibit">
sgrub thabs
</span>
. Given the use of the term in a number of Dunhuang titles to transliterate the Sanskrit 
<span class="bibit">
sādhanopāyikā
</span>
, we can confirm Eastman's hypothesis on this matter.

Though there is a break, this item seems to continue in some way from item one. Thus, having been constructed in item 1, the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is now used in a series of rituals. First the deities are invited into the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala,
</span>
whereupon offerings and confessions are made. This leads to all one's negativities being purified, and thus the text ends by saying,

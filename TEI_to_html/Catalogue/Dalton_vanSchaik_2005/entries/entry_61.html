This narrative texts sets out the origin and benefits of the practice of making the water 
<span class="bibit">
gtor ma
</span>
(
<span class="bibit">
chu gtor
</span>
). The story's main character is the king '

Khor lo drug pa

[Skt. *

Ṣaccakra

]. The story begins with his previous life as a 
<span class="bibit">
srin po
</span>
named 

Dzwa la kar ba

, who became a pious protector of Buddhism after being tamed by the Buddha. Before his conversion, however, the demon had killed many beings. As a result of his conversion he was reborn as the king, but because of his misdeeds he was struck with the illness called 
<span class="bibit">
tsi ti dzwa la
</span>
(
<span class="bibit">
cittijvala
</span>
, "enflamed mind"?). The king's son 

Mu khyud 'dzin

asks the 

Bhagavat

for help. The 

Bhagavat

instructs him to ask 

Mañjuśrī

, who in turn asks the 

Bhagavat

what he would do. The 

Bhagavat

advises him to offer a
<span class="bibit">
gtor ma
</span>
, and to invoke blessings through the six 
<span class="bibit">
mantras
</span>
and the six 
<span class="bibit">
mūdras
</span>
. This cures the king. An alternate version of the same story may be found in

. Unfortunately, another version (see

) is now missing. The other benefits of the 
<span class="bibit">
chu gtor
</span>
are said to be the liberation of all sentient beings from sickness and suffering. The practice of offering 
<span class="bibit">
chu gtor
</span>
, including the six 
<span class="bibit">
mantras
</span>
and six 
<span class="bibit">

At the top of this scroll fragment there is a rough diagram of a

, with four gates, a circle, and eight blade shapes radiating from two inner circles (compare

                false;">PT_60</a>
which includes several similar rough sketches). Underneath the sketch is written "the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
of the seven wrathful goddesses" (khro mo bdun gyi dkyil 'khor). As the text itself begins with a prayer to seven fierce female deities, this seems to be the title of the piece.
<br>
              
The first part of the text consists of seven verses of invitation to seven female deities: (i) 

Rdo rje kun grags

, (ii) 

Kun tu bzang mo

, (ii) 

Rdo rje kun gsal

, (iv) 

Rdo rje chen mo

, (v) 

Rdo rje sgron ma

, (vi) 

Rdo rje 'od chags

, (vii) 

Rdo rje g.yu sgron

. The second part of the text appears to be addressed to these figures, enjoining them to fulfill their commitments by destroying all enemies and obstacles. The third and last part of the text is a series of verses addresses to the goddess 

'Bar ma

, whose appearance is very fierce. The last part of the text uses the language of the

Although the three folios are numbered 

ka, 

kha

and 

ga, the beginning of the text appears to be missing. The verses indicate a series of offerings made by a series of goddesses to the five wisdoms and the four immeasurables. The first of the five wisdoms is not mentioned, but may be assumed to have appeared on the missing previous folio. Two deities are mentioned by name: 

Avalokiteśvara

and 

Mañjuśrī Kumāra

. The last verse concerns the whole assembly of goddesses, bound by the chain of 
<span class="bibit">
samaya
</span>
, who make the secret offering of non-duality. The final page (

3v

) contains the hundred syllable mantra, written in another hand.

("the

"--note that the transcription 
<span class="bibit">

</span>
is derived from the Sanskrit 
<span class="bibit">
sādhanopāyika
</span>
). Its relationship to the texts contained in the booklet is unclear--a similar partial inscription appears at the end of a text on 

27v.8

:

of the booklet. The Tibetan title appears on 

28v.3

along with a partial title in Tibetan transcription of Chinese: 

tshir kyu 'ji/ wur 'bu kye. The text on folio 

2r

, which is written upside-down, contains an homage with much the same wording as the Tibetan title (

2r.2

), and more Tibetan transcription of Chinese: 

tshir kyu 'ji tse 'jin ding keg gyib she 'phun 'sing jung ning. Finally, on 

28v.1

, above the titles, there is a transcription of a Sanskrit mantra, which includes an invocation of 

Kīlāya

. These pages may be related to the Chinese text in item 2.

This text is written upside-down and runs backwards from folios 

4v

to 

2v

. The text contains three rituals (
<span class="bibit">
cho ga
</span>
); which seem to be parts of a single practice. The first ritual is a treatment for insanity based around a fire offering which begins with the throwing of various kinds of metal filings on the fire. Five 
<span class="bibit">
phur ba
</span>
s are used to mark out the five corners of the space. The practitioner visualized himself as 

Vajrakhrodha,

and recites the mantra: 

Om badzra ya ksha ma ne pad me hūm/ kar ma pad me hūm/ badzra tsag kra phaṭ

(note the occurence of the element 

maṇi padme hūṃ, also found in the famous six syllable mantra of 

Avalokiteśvara

).
<br>
              
The second ritual (beginning on 

4r.7

) is for "men with obstructed water and women with inverted wombs" (myi chus bgags sam/ bud myed mang la log pa'i cho ga). The ritual is enacted by the practitioner on the behalf of the sick person, and involves repeatedly knotting and untying a thread. The thread is wound around a shinbone (
<span class="bibit">
the gu
</span>
), then mixed into a 
<span class="bibit">
gtor ma
</span>
. Both the shinbone and the 
<span class="bibit">
gtor ma
</span>
are cast away, symbolizing the casting out of the sickness.
<br>
              
The third ritual (beginning on 

2v.1

) is for men under the influence of 
<span class="bibit">
nāga
</span>
s, who suffer from aches and swellings or are crippled. The ritual involves moulding a frog from barley flour, making an ointment, and visualizing the overpowering of the 
<span class="bibit">
nāga
</span>
s by the deity 

Hayagrīva

This collection of rites can be identified by the occurance of the 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
of the deity 

Bhrukuṭi

throughout: 

Om 'bur kur ti. This mantra is said to be derived from the 
<span class="bibit">
no pyi ka
</span>
(

5r.3

). Scattered references to fire offerings indicate that the rites are performed in the context of a fire offering. The rituals, all directed towards various worldly goals, are as follows:
<br>
              
5v.1

: if you want a prophecy
<br>

This ritual manual centres on the practice of mirror divination (
<span class="bibit">
pra se na
</span>
). The preliminary practices and visualizations (described from 

11v.3 

to 

12v.5

) conclude with summoning the deities into the mirror. The divination ritual proper (

12v.6

to 

14v.8

) begins with homage to "the noble bird khyung" (bya rje khyung). Then, pouring scented water into the vase is described as "being blessed as the sky-soaring deity" (nam ka lding gi lhar byin gyi rlabs); visualizing oneself as the deity is described as "resting in entering the sky-soaring

samādhi" (bdag nyid nam ka lding gi ting nge 'dzin du bzhugs); and visualizing oneself sitting on a white lotus on a lake is described as "transforming oneself into the sky-soarer" (bdag nyid rnam ka lding gi bsgyur). A four-cornered 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is set up (

13v.4

) for the ritual. The main ritual objects are the mirror (
<span class="bibit">
mye long
</span>
), sword (
<span class="bibit">
ral gri
</span>
) and fingernail (
<span class="bibit">
sen mo
</span>
). Furthermore, an innocent child (
<span class="bibit">
byis pa gtsang ma
</span>
) is required to take part in the ritual.
<br>
              
The third and final section of the ritual (

14v.9

to 

16r.6

) is called "
<span class="bibit">
teaching the methods for being steady
</span>
" (
<span class="bibit">
myi g.yo bar bya ba'i thabs bstan pa
</span>
). This includes a ritual for bringing down a great rain which begins with settling in the 
<span class="bibit">
mahāmudrā
</span>
(

15v.1

) and a ritual for throwing the 
<span class="bibit">
gtor ma
</span>
, which begins with settling in the 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
of 

Vajrahūṃkara

(

16r.1

). Note the 
<span class="bibit">

This is a collection of rituals based around one deity, similar to Item 5 above. Here the deity is 

Avalokiteśvara

. At the beginning of this collection, the deity can be invited with the 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
of 

Avalokiteśvara

(

spyan ras gzigs dbang po

), the 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
of the thousand-armed form (

phyag stong spyan stong

) or the 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
of the form called 

Amoghapāśa

(

don yod zhags pa

). Another 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
which appears throughout these rituals, generally to be recited 21 times, is 

Om hri ha hum phat svā ha. Many of the rituals involve the concoction of medicines.
<br>

This ritual, which may be a continuation of the previous item, begins with instructions on the drawing of a 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala

<span class="bibit">
nāga
</span>
s (Tib. 
<span class="bibit">
klu
</span>
), and various 
<span class="bibit">

</span>
invocation mantras are used, especially 

Huṃ na ga huṃ. The 

Kīlāya

mantra is also employed (

<span class="bibit">

.
<br>
              
26r.3

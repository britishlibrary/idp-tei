A general discussion of the tantric system associated with the wrathful deity 

Dpal chen po

. The deity has three heads and six arms, his consort is named 

Krodhīśvarī

, and he is depicted trampling on the Hindu gods, 

Mahādeva

and 

Umadeva

. His 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is generated from the seed syllable, 

hūṃ, and seems to belong to the buddha family of 

Amitābha

(

snang ba mtha' yas

, see Rf.6v.1). An unfortunately unidentified root text (lung) is cited on how the deity only seems to be wrathful on the outside. In addition, a text called 
<span class="bibit">
Mye'i lung
</span>
is quoted in the context of describing the fires surrounding the deity.

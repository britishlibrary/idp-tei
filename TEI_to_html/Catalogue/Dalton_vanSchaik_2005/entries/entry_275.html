This concertina appears to be incomplete at the beginning and end, and to have a lacuna in the middle which is partially filled by another part of the same manuscript in the Pelliot collection: 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_288</a>
(discussed in entry to item 2). The first page of the concertina is the only one to contain seven lines of text; the other pages all contain only four or five lines.
<br>
              
The text on this first page may be connected with the following 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
of 

Avalokiteśvara

(in item 2). It is not complete. The empowerments of the mind and the body are mentioned in general terms. The last sentence on the page states that the nature of speech is the absorption and emanation of 

Avalokiteśvara

.

There is a lacuna in this section of the manuscript between folios 

Rf.4r

and 

Rf.4v

which is partially filled by 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_288:

Rf.4r

and the beginning of the 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_288:

</a>
and 

Rf.4v

. In both cases, the remaining lacuna is probably no more than two panels of text.
<br>
              
This is a 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
of 

Avalokiteśvara

which would probably fall into the 
<span class="bibit">
Yoga tantra
</span>
category. It agrees in many details with the 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
in the Pelliot manuscript 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_331</a>
and is also similar to the 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
found in a manuscript split between the Stein and Pelliot collections: 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ITJ_509</a>
and 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_320</a>
.
<br>
              
After the homage, the 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
is introduced with the phrase: "With the desire for the 
<span class="bibit">
siddhi
</span>
of noble

Avalokiteśvara

in this very life..." (

Rf.1v.2-4

de la 'phags pa spyan ras gzigs gyi dbang phyug/ tshe 'di nyid la dngos su grub par 'dod pas/). The meditator is enjoined to find a quite place, and to remember the master who gave the instructions on this practice. As a preliminary to the visualization, the meditator is to visualize a yellow 

Ōṃ

at the crown of the head, a red 

Aṃ

at the throat and a blue 

Hung

at the heart, and then to meditate "without fixation" (

Rf.3r.1-3

myi dmigs) that everything is natureless. Following this, a moon disc appears from the syllable 

Ā, and the celestial palace is visualized, manifesting from the syllable 

prung.
<br>
              
At this point comes the lacuna, and the text continues, after a break of one or two pages, on the first page of 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_288: 
verso
</a>
. The text picks up in the middle of the description of 

Avalokiteśvara

: 

Amitābha

crowns his head. He has two arms, one in the gesture of giving refuge, and one holding a red lotus. He sits cross-legged on a lotus. To the left of him is his consort, 

Chos kyi sems ma

. The meditator is to develop the 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
pride in himself as 

Bcom ldan 'das dpal chos kyi sems pa

(San. 

*Bhagavān Śrī Dharmasattva

), which seems to be another name for this form of 

Avalokiteśvara

. Note that in the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvatathagātha-tattvasaṃgraha
</span>
, 

Avalokiteśvara

belongs to the 
<span class="bibit">
dharma
</span>
family (which is identical with the 
<span class="bibit">
padma
</span>
family). Then the other deities of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
are described: In the eight directions are the eight offering goddess typical of the
<span class="bibit">
Yoga tantra
</span>
s. At the four gates are the four guardians. At this point 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_288: 
verso
</a>
comes to an end.
<br>
              
The text continues, after a brief lacuna, on 

Rf.4r

of the present manuscript. The meditator is enjoined to recite the 
<span class="bibit">
snying po
</span>
108 times. Then there is a visualization and recitiation of "the root 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
of the heart[-
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
] of approach" (

Rf.4v.1-3

nye ba'i snying po rtsa ba'i sngags). This 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
is 

Rf.4v.4

Ōṃ bā dzra dar mā rhri. This 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
contains the root syllables of 

Avalokiteśvara

(vajradharma) according to the 
<span class="bibit">
Vajradhātu
</span><span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
of the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvatathagātha-tattvasaṃgraha
</span>
(
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">P_112: 
223-3-5
</a>
). This is to be recited 1008 times or more, along with "the three suchnesses" (

Rf.5r.2

de kho na nyid gsum) until the meditator attains "stainlessness" (

Rf.5r.1

bye ma la). Then a single syllable is visualized, and the meditator is from outer objects such as sound. This appears to be the end of the main part of the 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
.
<br>
              
The last part of the text is said to be taken from "the ritual of the faultless mind" (

Rf.5v.2

skyon med sems gyi cho ga). It is introduced with the phrase "If you wish to dismiss..." (

Rf.5v.3-4

gtong bar 'dod na). The meditator is very briefly instructed to do the outer and inner 
<span class="bibit">

</span>
s and 
<span class="bibit">
mūdra
</span>
s, invite the deities, venerate them with the songs and dances of the yogic 
<span class="bibit">

s, do the aspirational prayer and confession, guard the body with the deity and celestial palace, always remember the deity and recite the

This text consists of six verses addressed to the five buddhas: (i) 

Myi bskyod pa

Akṣobhya

), (ii) 

Rnam par snang mdzad

(

), (iii)

), (iv)

Gdon mi za

(=

Amoghasiddhi

). In the final verse the prayer is referred to as "these peaceful verses of praise" (

Rf.9r.1

bstod tshogs zhi ba 'di rnams). There is some doubt regarding the last two verses, which appear separately in 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">LVP:

</a>
as the first text in this manuscript. These occur on 

Rf.8v-Rf.9r

. The text on the verso of the concertina (item 5) appears to be interrupted at this point, so there are probably also some pages missing from this text, and thus some verses missing in between the fourth and five verse.

This text, which continues from the recto side of the concertina to the verso, is incomplete because the concertina is missing several pages at the end.
<br>
              
The first lines of the text identify it as a treatise on the six kinds of 
<span class="bibit">
bskol mdo
</span>
, which might be translated as "boiled-down essentials." The six are: (i) view, (ii) 
<span class="bibit">
samaya
</span>
, (iii) recitation practice, (iv) purification through burning, (v) aspirational prayer, and (vi) 
<span class="bibit">
no pyi ka
</span>
: the method for accomplishment. Due to the incompleteness of the manuscript, we only have the beginning of the explanation of the first essential, and the end of the explanation of the sixth. A text on the same subject also appears in 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_240/2</a>
, although this manuscript (also a concertina) is also incomplete at the end, and only three of the six essentials are completely covered.
<br>
              
The lines that remain on the first essential state that the view is to be presented according to the texts of 

Chan

, 
<span class="bibit">
Sutra
</span>
and 
<span class="bibit">
Mantra
</span>
. The view is non-fixation and the naturelessness of appearances. On the verso, the end of the discussion of the sixth essential point is clearly the final part of a discussion of 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
practice.

These three verses address bodhisattvas of three of the five buddha families: (i) 

Vajrasattva Mahāsattva

, (ii) 

Ratnasattva Mahāsattva

, (iii) 

Dharmasattva Mahāsattva

. The verses are an invitation to each of the deities. Although only three of the five families are addressed, this text appears to be complete.

These verses, like the previous ones, are an invitation. They describe the five families as inseparable in nature, but nevertheless teaching individually. 

Vajrasattva

is invited to come with all of his emanations.

This is a fairly lengthy treatise directed at "the students of 
<span class="bibit">
yoga
</span>
." It is unfortunately incomplete at the end, and has a lacuna between 

Vf.6v

and 

Vf.7r

which is only partially filled by 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_288: 
recto
</a>
. The text is a commentary on seven injunctions (

Vf.6r.4-6v.3

): (i) to cut off ordinary phenomena (chos gyi la gcad); (ii) to examine the three realms (khams gsum brtag); (iii) to attain the five principals (gtso bo lnga brnyes); (iv) to maintain the five samayas (dam tshig lnga bsrung); (v) to accept the five nectars (bdud rtsi lnga dang du blang); (vi) to practice the ten nonvirtues ([myi] dge ba bcu spyad); (vii) to uphold the eight laws (khrims brgyad bca' 'o). This list is given at the beginning of the text, where the sixth injunction is listed as "to practice the ten virtues," but in the commentary on this line later in the text (

Vf.8r.3

) it is "nonvirtues", and this is certainly the correct reading, as the commentary makes clear.
<br>
              
The commentary on the first injunction is partially lost in the lacuna, though the end is picked up at the beginning of 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">PT_288: 
recto
</a>
, and some of the section on the third is also lost in the lacuna, before the text is picked up again in the present manuscript at 

Vf.7r

. There is no commentary on the fifth injunction, and the commentary on the seventh and last injunction is incomplete, with only a partial line of commentary remaining.

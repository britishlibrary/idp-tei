A complete manual for an intitiation ritual (
<span class="bibit">
dbang chog
</span>
) associated with the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvadurgatipariśodhana-tantra
</span>
(
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">P_116</a>
). The manual seems to be divided into three general sections. First the visualized 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is described (

1r.1-3v.5

), second a seven-day propitiation rite (
<span class="bibit">
bsnyen pa
</span>
) is performed (

3v.5-7r.3

), and third the initiation ceremony is described (

7r.3-18r.7

). 
<br>
              
Drawing mostly upon the second chapter of the tantra, the first section describes a forty-three deity 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
which consists of 

Śākyamuni

at the centre, surrounded by the four principal deities of the other buddha families. The latter four are in turn each surrounded by four bodhisattvas together comprising the "sixteen bodhisattvas of the good age" (
<span class="bibit">
bskal pa bzang po byang chub sems dpa' bcu drug
</span>
). There are also four additional deities in the intermediate directions. To these twenty-five deities are then added the four offering goddesses, the four guardians of the gates, and the gods of the ten directions. This may be a significant description, as its forty-two deities may explain the layout of the top storey of the 

Bsam yas

temple, which is said to have held a 

Sarvavid Vairocana

(associated with the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvadurgatipariśodhana-tantra
</span>
) surrounded by forty-two deities (on this issue, see 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Kapstein_2000:

</a>
).
<br>
              
The first section is also interesting for how it combines all three of the most popular early methods for organizing the generation of a 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
, namely (1) the 
<span class="bibit">
three concentrations
</span>
(San. 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
s) normally associated with 
<span class="bibit">
Mahāyoga
</span>
rituals, (2) the five complete enlightenments (San. 
<span class="bibit">
pañcābhisaṃbodhi
</span>
; Tib. 
<span class="bibit">
mngon par byang chub pa lnga
</span>
), and the four 
<span class="bibit">
mudrā
</span>
s. The work opens with the first of these, the three 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
s, by which the visualization of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
palace is generated out of emptiness. The five complete enlightenments are then employed to populate the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
with the principal deities (

1r.7-1v.4

). The role of the four 
<span class="bibit">
mudrā
</span>
s is less clear, but the 
<span class="bibit">
karmamudrā
</span>
and the 
<span class="bibit">
samayamudrā
</span>
seem to be used respectively to bring in the wisdom beings (San. 
<span class="bibit">
jñānasattva
</span>
; Tib. 
<span class="bibit">
ye shes sems dpa'
</span>
--see 

2r.3-2v.6

), and to activate the deities (see 

2v.6-3v.5

).
<br>
              
Section two, on the propitiation, consists of choosing the site (

3v.5-

), preparing the site (

4r.3-

), making the 
<span class="bibit"><span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span></span>
platform (

4r.9-

), performing the offerings, cleansings, recitations, and eliminating the obstructions (

4v.9-

), and laying the lines and drawing the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. The section ends with prayers, generation of 
<span class="bibit">
bodhicitta
</span>
, and prostrations to the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
(

6r.3-7r.3

).
<br>
              
The third and final section on the initiation rite draws upon the previous two ritual sections. The first part proceeds according to six subdivisions which are enumerated at the beginning of the section: (1) invitations (

7r.6

), (2) 
<span class="bibit">
karmamudrā
</span>
s (

10r.1

), (3) 
<span class="bibit">
samayamudrā
</span>
s (

10r.3

), (4) prostrations (

10r.6

), (5) offering goddess dances (lha mo gar mchod; 

10v.8

), and (6) praises (

11r.7-13v.7

). The 
<span class="bibit">
karmamudrā
</span>
s and the 
<span class="bibit">
samayamudrā
</span>
s are not described in detail, but can be seen in the tantra's first chapter (for an English translation, see 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Skorupski_1983: 
22-24
</a>
). Following these six subdivisions, the offerings are described (

13v.7-14r.5

). Then the stages of the main ritual sequence are enumerated (

14r.5-7

), and the student throws the flower (

14r.7-

), receives the 
<span class="bibit">
samaya
</span>
(

14v.5

), and is introduced to the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
(

15r.4

). Finally, the ten initiations are granted. These match those found in the tantra, except that the final eleventh initation of the union of wisdom and means (
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Skorupski_1983: 
338
</a>
: prajñopāyasamayoga) is missing from our manual. Considering how closely the present manuscript follows the root tantra's ritual passages, this difference may be significant, with bearings on the literary development of the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvadurgatipariśodhana-tantra
</span>
as well as tantric ritual technique more generally.

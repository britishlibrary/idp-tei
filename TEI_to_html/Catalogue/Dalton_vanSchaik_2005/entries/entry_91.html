This offering prayer requests the conquerors and various worldly deities to come and dispel the obstacles facing the land of Tibet. In every instance of the appearance of the phrase "land of Tibet" (
<span class="bibit">
bod khams
</span>
), the text has been defaced, so that the 
<span class="bibit">
na ro
</span>
character above 
<span class="bibit">
bod
</span>
and some or all of the syllable 
<span class="bibit">
khams
</span>
have been scratched out. This may suggest that the Tibetan specificity of the text was considered undesireable at some point. The last line attributes the prayer to a 

dge slong dpal brtsegs

, perhaps identical with the famous translator and author, 

ska ba dpal brtsegs

, although there is no similar text attributed to this figure in the 
<span class="bibit">
bstan 'gyur
</span>
. The folios are numbered from one to three, yet the text does nott seem to be continuous from one folio to the next, and begins abruptly on the first folio. Thus it appears that the numbers are a later addition, and the text is not actually complete. Some affiliation with the 
<span class="bibit">
VajrayƒÅna
</span>
is indicated by a buddha refered to as 

3r.2

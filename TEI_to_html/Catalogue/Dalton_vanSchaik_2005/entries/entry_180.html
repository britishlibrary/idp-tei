A complete 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
short enough to occupy only one folio. The 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
begins with a meditation on emptiness. This is followed by the generation of a 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
from seed syllables. The 
<span class="bibit">
māṇḍala
</span>
comprises the standard five buddhas of the 
<span class="bibit">
vajradhātu
</span><span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
, with 

Akṣobhya

of the 
<span class="bibit">
vajra
</span>
family at the centre. Then the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is dissolved and the practitioner visualizes him or herself as 

Vajrasattva

. There follows a brief instruction to make a general (
<span class="bibit">
spyi
</span>
) and offering (
<span class="bibit">
mchod
</span>
) 
<span class="bibit">
gtor ma
</span>
. Then four 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
s for the four elements are visualized. At the end of the visualization all sentient beings are completely satiated by a shower of nectar (
<span class="bibit">
bdud rtsi
</span>
). There follows a mantra for blessings, and another for transforming the body, speech and mind into the 
<span class="bibit">
samaya
</span>
. Finally, there is a warning of the dire consequences of violating the 
<span class="bibit">
samaya
</span>
, and a wrathful 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
.

The last lines of the text (see explicit below) state that the manuscript has been checked and no omissions or additions have been found. This seems to be written in the same hand as the rest of the text.

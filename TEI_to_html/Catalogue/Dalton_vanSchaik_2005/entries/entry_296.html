A very elaborate 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
which appears to be composed according to the three 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
(
<span class="bibit">
ting nge 'dzin gsum
</span>
). The first section, linked to the "suchness" (
<span class="bibit">
de bzhin nyid
</span>
) 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
, is a visualization of syllables in the practitioner's body which result in a non-conceptualization described as "one taste" (
<span class="bibit">
ro gcig
</span>
). The second section (

R1.12

) is linked to the "all-illuminating" (
<span class="bibit">
kun tu snang ba
</span>
) 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
(and this is the only place where the corresponding 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
is made explicit). It is a meditation on compassion based on the visualization of a moon disc in the sky, which grows from the size of the moon at the first day of the lunar month to the size of the moon at the 16th day. This moon symbolizes the accumulation of merit by the meditator and all sentient beings. The third and longest section (

R1.24

onwards), linked to the "causal" (
<span class="bibit">
rgyu
</span>
) 
<span class="bibit">
samādhi
</span>
, involves the visualization of the deities. This section appears to be composed of four parts. The first part is the development of the visualization of the two main deities, 

Vajrasattva

and his consort 

Samantabhadrī

. The two deities are visualized above the practitioner's head, to the right and left respectively (and therefore not in union). Unusually, 

Vajrasattva

is seated upon an elephant. In the second part (

R1.46

), subsidiary deities are visualized at the navels, hearts and tongues of each of the two main deities; thus there are six subsidiary deities in all. At the end of this part, the meditator is exhorted to develop the pride of the great seal (
<span class="bibit">
mahāmudrā
</span>
). The third part (

R1.70

) involves receiving the empowerment. Here, the celestial palace is visualized, and then ten further deities and their consorts appear, all with three heads and six arms but otherwise not described. The empowerment is received through these deities dissolving into the crown of the practitioner's head. The fourth part involves a visualization of the development of the white 
<span class="bibit">
bodhicitta
</span>
substance in the "secret heart centres" (
<span class="bibit">
gsang ba'i thugs ka
</span>
) of the male and female deities. Here, the secret places are represented by the deities 

Amoghasiddhi

and 

Samayatārā

. The white 
<span class="bibit">
bodhicitta
</span>
substance is transferred from the male deity to the female, and then back to the male (at no stage, however, are the two described as being in union). After this, the 
<span class="bibit">
bodhicitta
</span>
sprinkles (
<span class="bibit">
spreng ba
</span>
) downwards. There seems to be some connection here with the later popular 

Vajrasattva

purification practices. The final part of this 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
is very similar to

A 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana

based on the visualization of a 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. The central deity, appearing from the seed syllable 
<span class="bibit">
Hūṃ
</span>
, is 

Mahāśrīheruka

(

Dpal chen shi ri he ru ka

), blue in colour, with one head, three eyes, and four arms. He holds a skull cup, and objects called 
<span class="bibit">
rje'u
</span>
(probably an axe), 
<span class="bibit">
ba su ta
</span>
and 
<span class="bibit">
zhang
</span>
. He tramples on

Mahādeva

and his consort. The consort of 

Heruka

is 

Khrodīṣvarī

(

Khro mo dbang phyug ma

), who has the same attributes as 

Heruka

. Both deities have snakes coiled about their limbs. In the eight directions, eight goddesses appear from 
<span class="bibit">

</span>
syllables: 

Gauriī

, 

Caurika

, 

Pramoha

, 

Vetalī

, 

Ghasmari

, 

Kaṅkamukha

, 

Kākamukha

and 

Hulumukha

. The first five goddess usually appear in a group of eight goddess, which are to be seen in the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvabuddhasamāyoga-tantra
</span>
and 
<span class="bibit">
Guhyagarbha-tantra
</span>
. A 

Che mchog

Heruka
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala

which incorporates the eight goddesses in an inner circle and the eight animal-headed goddesses in an outer circle is described in 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Tucci_1949:

<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ITJ_718/2</a>
). Both groups of eight goddesses are in fact represented in the 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
s at the end of the text, and it is unclear whether the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
as described is complete, or a truncated version of what should be two concentric circles of eight goddesses each.
<br>
              
The inner 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is surrounded by a circle of owl-headed goddesses, then a circle of crow-headed goddesses, then a circle of crane-headed goddesses, and finally by a circle of vulture-headed goddesses. The 
<span class="bibit">
sādhana
</span>
continues with recitation of the mantras of all the deities, dissolution of the visualization, and resting in non-conceptualization.
<br>
              
All of the texts on this scroll, though not sharing the same hand, show a high occurence of irregular spelling. There are a number of frequent syllable substitutions, including:

A wrathful fire offering. First come the instructions for tracing the shape of the hearth on the ground. Secondly, the visualization of the main deity of the offering, the 

Mye'i lha

, who is also referred to as "one with matted locks on his head" (

<span class="bibit">

of blood. Thirdly, the offerings are described: an object called a

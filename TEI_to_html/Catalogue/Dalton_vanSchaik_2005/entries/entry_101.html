This manuscript is a compilation of instructions for the tantric master on the construction of 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
s and the performance of initiation rites. It is written in an crude hand, with great variation in orthography, suggesting an oral teaching transcribed by a person not well-versed in the Tibetan language.
<br>
              
The manuscript (a concertina) is incomplete at the beginning, so that the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
described in this first item is not identified. We join the text in the middle of detailed instructions on setting out a physical representation of a 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
on the ground. This is to be done using a variety of ritual props including streamers and pearls for delineating the circumference of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
, arrows or 
<span class="bibit">
phur bu
</span>
s for marking the edges, and knives for marking the gates. Five kinds of precious object (

Rf.1v.1

rin po che sna lnga) and five kinds of grain (

Rf.1v.1

'bru sna lnga) are used as offerings to the five gates. The master is then to teach the history of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
while holding a splint (

Rf.2r.4

chag shing). There follows a short 
<span class="bibit">
gtor ma
</span>
ritual in three parts. Then a lion throne is set up at the eastern side of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. The person being initiated, here referred to repeatedly as the patron (yon bdag), is then given permission to remain. Another person involved in the initiation ritual is referred to as the "ritual expert" (cho ga mkhan); it is unclear whether this is the tantric master or an assistant.
<br>
              
The main part of the initiation (

Rf.3r.4

) consists of offering various auspicious objects to the extended hand of 

Śākyamuni

. This is perhaps a statue, but it is impossible to tell due to the incompleteness of the manuscript. The following objects are offered: the precious householder, the precious queen, the precious horse, the precious general, the precious wheel, the precious jewel, the mirror of wisdom and the conch shell. The foodstuffs fish and yoghurt are offered. Finally, a crown with silk banners is placed on the head, and a garland of flowers around the neck.
<br>
              
The concluding activities (

Rf.5r.2

) include bathing (the statue?) prayers, and finally, clearing away the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
as a demonstration of the way of impermanence. This 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
shares several features with the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
s described in the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvadurgatipariśodana-tantra
</span>
which is mentioned by name in item 4. The physical setting-out of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
here may serve for the other rituals described below.

This text desribes a 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
which is referred to by the name of the country from which it is supposed to have originated, variously spelt as 

'dra byi'i dra, 

tra byid tra, and 

dra byid tra. These are probably attempts at transcribing the Indian place name 

Draviḍa

. The first part of the text provides the background to the ritual of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. The story describes how 

Vajrapaṇi

sent a bodhisattva (

Rf.6r.1

bo de swat twa) to defeat eighteen great obstructors (

Rf.5v.5

bgegs chen po) who were afflicting the people of 

Draviḍa

. Having completed his task, the bodhisattva displays the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. The central figure of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is named only as "the vajra sentry" (rdo rje bya ra). The cardinal directions are occupied by 

Vajrapaṇi

, 

Vajraratna

, 

Vajrapadma

and 

Vajrayakṣa

. The intermediate directions are occupied by other forms of 

Vajrapaṇi

. The description omits the nortwest direction. The mantras accompanying these deities invoke a different series of deities in wrathful form: 1. 

Aparājitā

; 2. 

Yamāntaka

; 3. 

Hayagrīva

; 4. 

Amṛtakuṇḍali

; 5. 

Acala

; 6. [missing]; 7. 

Mahābala

; 8. 

Nīlakaṇṭha

.
<br>
              
The text then briefly describes the physical actviites for setting up of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. These are brief and seem to assume that the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
has already been set up, possibly in accordance with the instructions in Item 1. There is no description of an initiation ritual.

This section of the manuscript offers instructions on displaying the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
of 

Amoghapāśa

. There is a brief description of the physical setting up of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
, and the text appears to assume that the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
has already been set up as described in Item 1. The main difference in this ritual is that a vase is placed at the centre of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. Note that in the illustrated mandala Ch.00379 (National Museum, New Delhi, reproduced in 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Klimburg-Salter_1982: 
p.147
</a>
) a healing ritual is depicted in which the centre of the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
is occupied by a vase. The text goes on to list the 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
s for the deities at the centre and the eight directions, and in additional, the 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
s for the eight bodhisattvas.

The text now turns to the 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
of the 
<span class="bibit">
*Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatejorāśi
</span>
(
<span class="bibit">

; 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">P_116</a>
). Note that this differs slightly from the usual name of the tantra 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatejorāja
</span>
(
<span class="bibit">
ngan song thams cad rnam par sbyong ba gzi brjid kyi rgyal po
</span>
).
<br>
              
The text begins with instructions to supplicate the deity at the centre (unnamed), the eight 
<span class="bibit">
uṣṇīśa
</span>
(
<span class="bibit">
gtsug tor
</span>
), the four offering goddesses, the eight bodhisattvas, the ten protectors and the four gate guardians. These can be identified with figures from the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvadurgatipariśodhana-tantra
</span>
. Then the text gives the instructions for supplicating the deities of the 

Draviḍa
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
(see Item 2), followed by the instructions for supplicating the 

Amoghapāśa
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
(see Item 3).
<br>
              
The text now returns to an exposition of the 
<span class="bibit">
*Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatejorāśi
</span><span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. The background to the ritual is provided in two stories. The first is the story of 

Lha Nor bu dri ma myed pa'i 'od

(

Deva Maṇivimalaprabha

), a god who falls from heaven into the hells. 

Vajrapāṇi

sends 

Śākyamuni

to save the god by reciting a 
<span class="bibit">
mantra
</span>
. The second story concerns a figure called 

Dgra myi skye

("unborn enemy," a name possibly related to 

Ma skyes dgra

; Skt. 

Ajātaśatru

) who having killed his father 

Lus myi bde

("unhappy body") is subjected to rebirth among the six classes of beings. Subsequently remembering his crime, 

Dgra myi skye

asks for help from 

Śākyamuni

, who reveals the 
<span class="bibit">
*Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatejorāśi
</span><span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
. Compare these stories with the version in the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatejorāja-tantra
</span>
and 
<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">ITJ_712</a>
.
<br>
              
The 
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
itself is very similar to the 

Śākyamuni
<span class="bibit">
maṇḍala
</span>
which appears at the beginning of chapter 2 of the 
<span class="bibit">
Sarvadurgatipariśodhana-tantra
</span>
. 

Śākyamuni

appears at the centre surrounded by eight deities of the 
<span class="bibit">
uṣṇīśa
</span>
(
<span class="bibit">
gtsug tor
</span>
) type. Also appearing are four offering goddesses, eight bodhisattvas and four Indian gods. At this point we come to the end of the manuscript, so we do not have the complete description of this

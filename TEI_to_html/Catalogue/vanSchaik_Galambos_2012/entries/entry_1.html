              This is addressed to the residence of the great master Yönten Chog:
                                Toleu Tagsum inquires regarding your health. According to what you
                                said in the letter brought by your servant, your body is not
                                fatigued by your meditation, and your authority is undiminished. In
                                this letter I enquire devotedly about your health, and ask how I may
                                fulfil your commands.<br>
               May I ask a favour regarding a Chinese monk who has been in my
                                presence? The monk wishes to go to India to see the relics of
                                Śākyamuni. If the abbot were to travel across to Liangzhou [with the
                                monk] it would not be such a great burden. If [the abbot] cannot
                                travel there, then a servant could accompany the monk. I beg you to
                                consider your commitments. The monk will give you more detailed
                                information.<br>
               Furthermore, this is addressed to the residence of the abbot: if
                                this letter comes to you, and you do comply with this request
                                immediately, it would be improper not to send back a letter of
                                confirmation. If you have complied with this request, please do so
                                by summer this year.<br>

               This is a petition from the patron Ngog Luzhi Namka. A
                                Chinese monk from China who is unequalled as a great ascetic, a
                                great scholar and a great upholder of virtue is going to India to
                                see the sites of Śākyamuni. His route is as follows. Proceeding from
                                Wutaishan he arrived at the gold and turquoise halls of Hezhou;
                                after that he arrived at the mountain of Dantig Shan; after that he
                                arrived at the gold and turquoise halls of Tsongka; after that he
                                will arrive at the palace of Liangzhou; after that he will arrive at
                                the castle of Ganzhou; after that he will arrive at Shazhou. After
                                that he will certainly go to see the great teachers of Śrī Nālandā
                                and the relics of Śākyamuni at the Vulture’s Peak in India.<br>
              Up to this point [in the monk’s journey] both Chinese and Tibetans
                                have [treated him] honourably... and conducted him stage by stage.
                                From this point onward, ... [he should be treated] honourably. Treat
                                him as an object of veneration and conduct him stage by stage. [If]
                                anyone harms him or obstructs his virtuous activities, be they
                                Chinese or Tibetan, ... the news will carried away on the winds to
                                the ten directions. This is Namka’s message: let nobody hurt [the
                                monk]!<br>

              This is addressed to the great teacher: a petitioning letter from
                                Markham Rinchen Dorje. Please write a letter to say whether your
                                body has been weakened by your profound meditation and whether, even
                                though there are no obstacles to your meditation on the nature of
                                reality (dharmatā), your precious self may have fallen ill.<br>
              On to other matters. A Chinese monk who is learned and an upholder of
                                virtue is travelling from China to India to pay homage to the relics
                                of Śākyamuni. It would be improper not to escort him to the Dayun
                                monastery. Consider your commitments.<br>

              This is addressed to the great elders and the great monks of the
                                Longxing temple: a petitioning letter from Mog Bumdag. According to
                                previous letters that have gone back and forth [between us], I hear
                                that you have no injuries or disease and your bodies as valuable as
                                gemstones are free from infirmity. Please send a letter about your
                                health.<br>
              On to other matters. A monk from the empire of China, a great
                                upholder of virtue, is going to the land of India in order to see
                                the face of Śākyamuni. Up to this point we lowly ones, the spiritual
                                guides of Serpa, have escorted him stage by stage. Therefore the
                                spiritual guides who consider their vows of benevolence, the ... [of
                                the] kingdom, the uncle-ministers and the rest should consider their
                                vows and the kingdom. Escorting [the monk] by stages, take him to
                                the Dayun monastery. It would be improper not to do so. I ask those
                                in the religious and the secular spheres to consider this.<br>

              This is addressed to the lords of the teachings and the monastic
                                community, they who unite the sun and the moon, the sublime
                                ornaments of Jambudvīpa, the assembly of teachers who [venerate]
                                their precious enlightened masters and who single-mindedly carry out
                                their commitments: a petitioning letter from Dmog ‘bum bdag.
                                According to what has been said in the previous letters that have
                                gone back and forth [between us], your meditative activities of
                                maintaining all the vehicles, ... becoming accomplished,
                                single-mindedly [carrying out] your vows have not fatigued your
                                bodies. I hear that your precious bodies, as valuable as gemstones,
                                are free from infirmity. I request with devotion a letter from the
                                thirty great emanations.<br>
              On to other matters. A monk coming from the presence of the Chinese
                                emperor Tong kun, a great ascetic and a particularly fine scholar,
                                is going to India to see the face of Śākyamuni. Up to this point we
                                the monks of the Serpa thousand district have escorted him stage by
                                stage. Accordingly, from this point onward, [avoiding] unhappiness,
                                not to consider your commitments and conduct him to the monastic
                                estate of Longxing would be improper. It would be improper for any
                                in the religious and secular spheres not to consider
                            likewise.<br>

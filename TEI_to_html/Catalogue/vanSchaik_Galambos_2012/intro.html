      <p>This is a translation and transcription of five letters of passage, written for a
                Chinese monk in the late tenth century, for his journey through Tibetan regions of
                what are now the Chinese provinces of Qinghai and Gansu. The letters are found on
                the first part of the manuscript, IOL Tib J 754(A). This scroll was found glued
                together with two other manuscripts that the pilgrim acquired on his travels. The
                longest part is IOL Tib J 754(B), with a Chinese sūtra on the recto and Tibetan
                tantric texts on the verso. Finally, the smallest part is IOL Tib J 754(C), which
                has a Chinese text commemorating the building of a monastery near Liangzhou, which
                turns out to be a copy of an inscription from the early seventh century. Crucially,
                the colophon to this manuscript states that the copy was made in 968 by the monk
                Daozhao, thus providing us with a date and a name.</p>
      <p>The letters are written to a conventional pattern, with the exception of Letter 2,
                which has no addressee and is therefore an open rather than personal letter. The
                personal letters begin with the name or title of the addressee, followed by a phrase
                literally meaning “from the presence of ...” (<span class="bibit">zha snga nas</span>)
                but effectively meaning “addressed to ....” Then we have the name of the author of
                the letter, followed by the phrase “a letter submitted by ...” (<span class="bibit">mchid gsol ba</span>). This is followed by a polite enquiry regarding whether
                the addressee is fatigued or not. It is interesting that in our letters the enquiry
                about fatigue specifically addresses fatigue caused by meditation. This may be a
                variation on the formula, used when the addressee is a monk. Another apparently
                formulaic feature of the letters is the phrase “consider your commitments” (<span class="bibit">thugs dam la dgongs pa</span>), which appears toward the end of
                Letters 1, 3 and 5. This may have been a standard conclusion to a request directed
                at a monk</p>
      <p>The letters of passage are undoubtedly an important historical
                source. They contain information about the Tibetan-ruled areas of Qinghai and Gansu
                not found anywhere else. Their date, from the late 960s, falls at the end of a
                historical ‘dark period’ for this region, when both Tibet and China were politically
                fragmented. The document offers no narrative as such, but is a primary source of
                information on regional towns, rulers, monasteries and monks. Earlier, in chapter 3,
                we followed the pilgrim’s route as outlined in the second letter – beginning in
                Wutaishan, and then travelling to Hezhou, Dantig Shan, Tsongka, Liangzhou, Ganzhou
                and Shazhou, with the ultimate destination being Nālandā in India. The places in
                which these letters were written surely overlap to some extent with this itinerary,
                although clear indications of the location of their authors are unfortunately
                lacking.</p>

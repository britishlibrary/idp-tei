              . . . should send and bring [this] letter to Samarkand. And [the
                                noble lord Varzakk . . . should receive(?)] it all(?) [complete(?)].

              To the noble lord Varzakk (son of) Nanai-thvar (of the
                                family) Kanakk. Sent [by] his servant Nanai-vandak.<br>

          <span class="notheader">Section: Recto</span><br>
            
              To the noble lord Varzakk (son of) Nanai-thvar (of the
                                family) Kanakk, 1,000 (and) 10,000 (times) blessing (and) homage on
                                bended knee, as is offered to the gods, sent by his servant
                                Nanai-vandak. And, sirs, (it would be) a good day for him who might
                                see you happy (and) free from illness; and, sirs, (news of) your
                                (good) health having been heard (by me), I consider myself
                                immortal!<br>
              And, sirs, Armat-sach in Jiuquan (is) safe (and) well and Arsach in
                                Guzang (is) safe (and) well. And, sirs, it is three years since a
                                Sogdian came from "inside" [i.e. from China]. I settled(?)
                                Ghotam-sach, and (he is) safe (and) well. He has gone to Kwr¹ynk,
                                and now no-one comes from there so that I might write to you about
                                the Sogdians who went "inside," how they fared (and) which countries
                                they reached. And, sirs, the last emperor, so they say, fled from
                                Luoyang because of the famine, and fire was set to his palace and to
                                the city, and the palace was burnt and the city [destroyed]. Luoyang
                                (is) no more, Ye (is) no more! Moreover, the . . . Huns(?), and they
                                . . . Changan, so that they hold(?) it(?) . . . as far as N'yn'ych
                                and as far as Ye, these (same) Huns [who] yesterday were the
                                emperor's (subjects)! And, sirs, we do not know wh[ether] the
                                remaining Chinese were able to expel the Huns [from] Changan, from
                                China, or (whether) they took the country beyond(?). And [. . . in .
                                . . there are] a hundred freemen from Samarkand . . . in [. . .]
                                Dry'n there are forty men. And, sirs, your [. . . it is] three years
                                since [. . . came] from "inside" . . . unmade (cloth)(?). And from
                                Dunhuang up to Jincheng in . . . to sell, linen cloth is going [=
                                selling well?], and whoever has unmade (cloth)(?) or<span class="bibit">raghzak</span>(which is) not (yet) brought (to
                                market)(?), not (yet) taken, [can](?) sell [all](?) of it . . . And,
                                sirs, as for us, whoever dwells (in the region) from Ji[ncheng](?)
                                up to Dunhuang, we (only) survive [lit. "have breath"] so long as
                                the . . . lives, and (we are) without family(?), both old and on the
                                point of death. If this were not (so), [I would] not be ready(?) to
                                write to you (about) how we are. And, sirs, if I were to write to
                                you everything (about) how China has fared, (it would be) beyond(?)
                                grief: there is no profit for you (to gain) therefrom. And, sirs, it
                                is eight years since I sent Saghrak and Farn-aghat "inside" and it
                                is three years since I received a reply from there. They were well .
                                . ., (but) now, since the last evil occurred, I do [not] receive a
                                reply from there (about) how they have fared. Moreover, four years
                                ago I sent another man named Artikhu-vandak. When the caravan
                                departed from Guzang, Wakhush[akk] the . . . was there, and when
                                they reached Luoyang, bo[th the . . .] and the Indians and the
                                Sogdians there had all died of starvation. [And I] sent Nasyan to
                                Dunhuang, and he went "outside" [i.e. out of China] and entered
                                (Dunhuang), (but) now he has gone without (obtaining) permission
                                from me, and he has (received) a great retribution and was struck
                                dead in the . . .<br>
              Lord Varzakk, my greatest hope is in your lordship! Pesakk (son of)
                                Dhruwasp-vandak holds 5[...]4 staters from me and he put it on
                                deposit(?), not to be transferred, and you should hold [it . . .]
                                sealed from now (on), so that without (my) permission . . .
                                Dhruwasp-van[dak] . . .<br>
              [Lord] Nanai-thvar, you should remind Varzakk that he should
                                withdraw(?) this deposit(?), and you should (both) count [it], and
                                if the latter is to hold it, then you should (both) add(?) the
                                interest to the capital and put it in a transfer document, and you
                                (Nanai-thvar) should give this too to Varzakk. And if you (both)
                                think (it) fit that the latter should not hold it, then you should
                                (both) take it and give it to someone else whom you do think fit, so
                                that this money may thereby become more. And, behold, (there is) a
                                certain orphan . . . dependent(?) on this income(?), and if he
                                should live and reach adulthood [lit. "years"], and he has no hope
                                of (anything) other than this money, then, Nanai-thvar, (when) it
                                should be heard that Takut has departed(?) to the gods -- the gods
                                and my father¹s soul (will) be a support(?) to you! -- and when
                                Takhsich-vandak is grown up [lit. "big"], then give him a wife and
                                do not send him away from yourself. Mortal(?) gratification(?) has
                                departed(?) from us(?) in the . . ., because (from) day (to) day we
                                expect murder(?) and robbery. And when (the two of) you need cash,
                                then you (Nanai-thvar) should take either 1,000 staters or 2,000
                                staters out of the money. And Wan-razmak sent to Dunhuang for me 32
                                (vesicles of) musk belonging to Takut so that he might deliver them
                                to you. When they are handed over you should make five shares, and
                                therefrom Takhsich-vandak should take three shares, and Pesakk
                                (should take) one share, and you (should take) one share..<br>

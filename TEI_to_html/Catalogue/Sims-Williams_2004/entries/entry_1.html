            From her daughter, the free-woman Miwnay, to her d[ear] mother

              [From her dau]ghter, the free-woman Mi[wnay], to her dear
                                [mother] Chatis, blessing and homage. It would be a good day for him
                                who might [see] you healthy and at ease; and [for me] that day would
                                be the best when we ourselves might see you in good health. I am
                                very anxious to see you, but have no luck. I petitioned the
                                councillor Sagharak, but the councillor says: Here there is no other
                                relative closer to Nanai-dhat than Artivan. And I petitioned
                                Artivan, but he says: Farnkhund ..., and I refuse to hurry, I refuse
                                to ... And Farnkhund says: If your husband’s relative does not
                                consent that you should go back to your mother, how should I take
                                you? Wait until ... comes; perhaps Nanai-dhat will come. I live
                                wretchedly, without clothing, without money; I ask for a loan, but
                                no-one consents to give me one, so I depend on charity from the
                                priest. He said to me: If you go, I will give you a camel, and a man
                                should go with you, and on the way I will look after you well. May
                                he do so for me until you send me a letter!<br>

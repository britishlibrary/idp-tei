              [On another part of the verso] From (his) servant [left

              To (my) noble lord (and) husband Nanai-dhat, blessing (and)
                                homage on bended knee, as is offered to the gods. And (it would be)
                                a good day for him who might see you healthy, happy (and) free from
                                illness, together with everyone; and, sir, when I hear (news of)
                                your (good) health, I consider myself immortal!<br>
              Behold, I am living ..., badly, not well, wretchedly, and I consider
                                myself dead. Again and again I send you a letter, (but) I do not
                                receive a (single) letter from you, and I have become without hope
                                towards you. My misfortune is this, (that) I have been in Dunhuang
                                for three years thanks(?) to you, and there was a way out a first, a
                                second, even a fifth time, (but) he(!) refused to bring me out. I
                                requested the leaders that support (should be given) to Farnkhund
                                for me, so that he may take me to (my) husband and I would not be
                                stuck in Dunhuang, (for) Farnkhund says: I am not Nanai-dhat’s
                                servant, nor do I hold his capital. I also requested thus: If he
                                refuses to take me to (my) husband, then ... such support for me
                                that he may take me to (my) mother. The leaders say: Here in
                                Dunhuang there is no other relative closer than Artivan, (but)
                                Artivan [say]s: Farnkhund ... whatever ... to do for you. If(?) I(?)
                                (had) no guarantee, no protection, my father ... I have become ...
                                not ... How much more would I have ... by my father if ... a servant
                                of the Chinese! A free man ... who found ... and ... keeps (his)
                                clothing in good condition(?). And you write (your) bidding to me
                                about everything in ... so that I should ... you and I should know
                                how to think, and if I do not ... you, then you write to me so that
                                I should know how to serve the Chinese. In my paternal abode I did
                                not have such a restricted ... as with(?) you. I obeyed your command
                                (lit. took your command upon my head) and came to Dunhuang and I did
                                not observe (my) mother’s bidding nor (my) brothers’. Surely(?) the
                                gods were angry with me on the day when I did your bidding! I would
                                rather be a dog’s or a pig’s wife than yours! And for me ...<br>
              Sent by (your) servant Miwnay. This letter was written in the third
                                month on the tenth day.<br>

              From (his) daughter Shayn to the noble lord Nanai-dhat,
                                blessing (and) homage. And (it would be) a good [day] for him [who]
                                might see [you] healthy, rested (and) happy. ... I have become ...
                                and I watch over a flock of domestic animals. Differently to you, I
                                had a ..., and ... went out. I am ... and I know that you do not
                                lack twenty staters(?) to send. It is necessary to consider the
                                whole (matter). Farnkhund has run away; the Chinese seek him but do
                                not find him. Because of Farnkhund’s debts we have become the
                                servants of the Chinese, I together with (my) mother.<br>

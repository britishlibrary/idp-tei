      <p>ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION by Prof. Daniel C. Waugh, University of Washington (2004)</p>
      <p>The Sogdians, a people of Iranian origin, were important in the commerce of the Silk
                Road between the fourth and ninth centuries CE. From their home in the region near
                today's Samarkand in Central Asia (their core territory straddled what is now
                southern Uzbekistan and Western Tajikistan), Sogdian merchants traveled across
                Eurasia. Chinese chronicles noted their commercial acumen; members of the Sogdian
                colonies established in China came to function as administrators. The Sogdian
                language was used widely for communication along the trade routes, and Sogdians were
                among the translators of Buddhist scriptures in China. The Sogdian presence in what
                is now northern Pakistan is attested by inscriptions carved on rocks in the remote
                mountain valleys through which the trade routes passed. Archaeologists have
                uncovered in the Sogdian city states of Central Asia impressive architecture and
                painting which help document a flourishing cosmopolitan urban culture of a people
                who themselves never created a great empire.</p>
      <p>Among the most important documents of Sogdian history are five nearly complete
                letters, discovered in 1907 by the famous British archaeologist Aurel Stein in a
                Chinese watch tower just west of the Jade Gate, a fortified outpost guarding the
                western approaches to the administrative and cultural center of Dunhuang (at the
                western end of today's Gansu Province). Stein's discovery was some 90 km. west of
                Dunhuang and 550 km. east of Lou-lan, another important outpost on the southern
                branch of the silk route, which skirted the Taklamakan Desert. It seems likely that
                the letters were confiscated by a Chinese garrison at a time when Chinese control
                this far west was being threatened. While there has been considerable controversy
                over the dating of the letters, the most persuasive arguments (supported by Prof.
                Sims-Williams and his colleagues) point to 313 (-314) C.E. Two of the letters were
                sent by a lady in distress who had been abandoned in Dunhuang (nos. 1 and 3); the
                other two letters reproduced here (nos. 2 and 5) concern commercial activity of the
                writers. While a whole archive of Sogdian documents from several centuries later has
                been discovered in Central Asia, the Sogdian ancient letters are the earliest
                substantial examples of Sogdian writing and thus provide extremely important
                information about the early history of the Sogdian diaspora along the eastern end of
                the silk route.</p>
      <p>The author of letter 2 likely was resident in Jincheng (today, Lanzhou), a town in
                Gansu at the gateway to the Hexi Corridor, the passage between the southern
                mountains and northern deserts which leads to Dunhuang. He was writing to the "home
                office" in Samarkand. The first part of the letter concerns the Sogdian diaspora in
                China and contains the information about the destruction by the Huns of two
                important Chinese cities, Yeh and the then capital, Luoyang (the latter occurred in
                311 CE). The second part of the letter concerns the distribution of funds that the
                writer had apparently left on deposit at home.</p>
      <p>The author of letter 5 was writing from Guzang, the modern Wu-wei, located northwest
                of Luoyang in the Hexi Corridor. The addressee of the letter may have been resident
                in Khotan, an important town along the southern silk route just before it crosses
                the Pamir Mountains to reach the oases of Transoxania, the region between the Amu
                Darya and Syr Darya rivers. This letter also refers to the chaos and difficult
                conditions in China; the author's position had apparently been made the more
                difficult when his commercial partner, Ghawtus, abandoned him. Thus the author was
                forced to return from Dunhuang to Guzang.</p>
      <p>The letters include the names of several products--silver, linen and a kind of
                unprocessed cloth, musk (whose source was Tibet), pepper, and "white" (probably
                white lead powder, a valuable commodity used in cosmetics and drugs). Unfortunately
                the meaning of some terms for other products is not known. It appears from the
                quantities mentioned that the trade was relatively small-scale and, as we might
                expect, focussed on goods with high value for the weight.</p>

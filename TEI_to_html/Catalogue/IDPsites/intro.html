      <p>These site reports have been been prepared by IDP researchers and are individually credited. Thanks are owing to Catherine Till and Zhang Wenhui who carried out much of the preliminary research. Work on these is still in progress. Full reports are prepared to a template (see Bezeklik) and contain detailed information on the site, dating, excavation history, and nature and location of finds. Comments and additions to these reports are welcome.</p>
      <p>Note: Names of sites within Chinese Central Asia are referred to by the common name they are known by today but alternative names are given here. Subject to funding, IDP plans to prepare an online historical gazetteer of the Silk Road.</p>

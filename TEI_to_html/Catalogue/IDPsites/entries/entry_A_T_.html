            At Aratam an agglomeration of Buddhist shrines stand erected at a site held sacred as marking the mouth of a stream precious to the agricultural population. Some temple ruins were scattered along the hills, others were cut deep into a ridge of clay extending for 12 metres from east to west. There are cellas/caves in the southern face of the ridge, each appearing to have contained a giant Buddha image. Stein dated the shrine from the period of Uighur domination (9th-12th centuries) based on the similarity of the remains of mural decoration in the rock-cut caves to those from later caves at Dunhuang.<br>

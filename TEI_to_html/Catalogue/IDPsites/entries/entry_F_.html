            At the site of Farhadnbegyailaki remains are scattered over an extensive area of approximately six square miles. The ruins had suffered from exploitation from villagers and woodcutters in search of saltpetre. Almost all ruined structures occupied erosion terraces rising four and a half metres above the ground, and thus were spared from damage by water nearby. This indicates ruins could be earlier than Dandan and Khadalik. To the northwest of the groups of ruins, there lay small ‘Tati’ areas strewn with ancient pottery debris. A small stupa base was also found.<br>

            Bashkoyumal is a ruined shrine about five miles south of Charkhlik, and is part of a circumvallation, semi-lunar in form. The remainder of the circumvallation has been washed away by prolonged encroachment of the river. A large wall close to the edge of the plateau has survived. Its position suggests that it belonged to a central keep or tower of a ruined fort. To the south of this broken wall running from this gate towards the central structure stands a decayed mound, which contained the square base of a Stupa or shrine with an enclosing passage. A large and well-preserved Pothi leaf on silk was found, inscribed on both sides with a Buddhist text in Sanskrit and in Brahmi script of the Gupta type (Or.8212/1594, see<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Zwalf_1998</a>). Stein writes that this is the first specimen of a manuscript on silk in the Indian language. The fort was occupied during early Tang times.<br>

            Previous explorations by Stein in 1906 near the site of Khadalik, and in 1908 at Farhad-Begyailaki had proved that remains of settlements dating from the Buddhist period were plentiful in the desert belt immediately north and north-east of the present oasis of Domoko. The site of Kudukkol proved to be a patch of wind-eroded ground about 130 metres across, covered with pottery debris.<br>
            A low shapeless mound on the eastern edge of this area marked the ruin. The remains of a shrine were discovered. On clearing a small mound composed of sand and debris, Stein reached the plastered floor at a depth of just over a metre. The numerous fragments of plaster painted in tempera found amidst the debris indicated that the walls had been decorated with compositions in the style of the mural paintings of which Stein had recovered the remains in 1906 from the ruin of the main temple of Khadalik. Stein mentions the representation of a miniature Stupa with pennons, and the head of a Trimurti figure, similar to that on the Dandan-oilik panel D.vii.6.<br>
            The remains at Kudukkol, despite their paucity, serve to prove that the shrine belongs to the same period as the temples of the Khadalik site, situated some 5 kilometres to the north, and is likely to have been similarly abandoned about the end of the eighth century.<br>

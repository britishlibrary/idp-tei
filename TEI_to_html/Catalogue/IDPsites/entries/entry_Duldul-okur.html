            Stein visited Duldulokur in the Kucha region near the east bank of Muzart river ten miles south-west of Kucha town on his third expedition. The base of a ruined stupa survives. Fragments of hard-coloured stucco were found below the western face of the stupa base. Other fragments included a wooden vesica and halo finely carved in relievo, probably serving as a Buddhist image. These pieces seem to date from Tang times. On a steep gully, a thin layer of refuse similar to that found at Mazartagh was found. A semicircular brick wall had decayed almost to the ground. Its purpose remains obscure, but could account for the local designation Duldul-okur, derived from Persian Duldul-akhur, 'the manger of Duldul', the name of Rustam’s horse famous in popular legend.<br>

            The site of Akterek lies about 20 miles north-east of Khotan. Stein found ruins of a temple and Buddhist shrine along with fragments of small relievo seated Buddhas. Only small fragments have been preserved after an earlier fire. The smaller pieces had been enveloped by the fire, producing the effect of a regular firing, which preserved them. All the sculptures had completely decayed under atmospheric influences. The only coin discovered was a cash piece of the uninscribed type found in the Former and later Han dynasties. Terracotta monkeys, familiar from Yotkan culture-strata, were also found. If this dating is correct, it yields insights into the period when this old Khotan art flourished. The significance of this site stems less from the archaeological remains than from the instructive glimpses offered of remains that may lie buried beneath the ‘Tatis’. This area of shifting dunes and bare loess undergoing wind erosion is likely to hide more treasures.<br>

            <span class="notheader">1: General Introduction</span><br>
              The ruins at Miran consist of a large rectangular fort, a monastery (The Vihara), several stupas and many sun-dried brick constructions, located relatively close to the ancient caravan track to Dunhuang, running west to east. In the fort Stein found Tibetan documents on wood and paper, fragments with a Turkish runic script, palm-leaf documents inscribed with Brahmi characters and Kharoshthi texts on silk. In the temples, shrines and stupas Stein discovered Buddhist stucco reliefs, sculptures and frescoes in the Graeco-Buddhist Gandhara style, Kharoshthi inscriptions from the 3rd c. AD within a painted frieze, wooden carved objects, textiles and fragments of architectural objects.<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">2: History of the site</span><br>
              In pre-historical times the Lop Nor region, of which Miran is a part, was occupied by a people of possibly Indo-European origin. By the end of the first millenium BC, it was part of the Shanshan empire. During the second century AD it came under the influence of the Kushan Empire, which may have accelerated the spread of Buddhist art and literature in the area. By the third century, there were Buddhist monasteries throughout the Shanshan empire, and Miran may have been the administrative centre of Buddhism in the empire. The paintings and sculptures found in Miran are probably the earliest on the Silk Road, and show the strong influence of the Gandharan art of the Kushans. Miran was abandoned by the fifth century, but occupied once again in the eighth century by the Tibetan army, which built Miran fort (M.I.) and cultivated the surrounding area for farming. Some time after the Tibetan empire fell in the mid-ninth century, Miran was abandoned once again.<br>
              Miran was called Yixun or Yixiu in the Han dynasty. Later it was called Little Shanshan, in contrast to the principal city in the region. The Chinese also referred to it as Qitun and Tun, probably at the same time that it was also known as Seton to the Tuyuhun and Rtse-'ton to the Tibetans. In the eighth and ninth centuries it was known to the Tibetans as Nob-chung, or Little Nob.<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">3: History of exploration of the site</span><br>
              1876: First person to mention the ancient site was Colonel Nikolai Mikhailovich Przhevalsky. After his second expedition to the region, he talked about a very large ruined city near the Lopnor Lake, which, judging from its geographical position on his map, must have been Miran.<br>
              1905: Ellsworth Huntington, an American geologist, the first to examine Miran, identified the fort, the monastery and two stupas during a short visit, and recognized the Buddhist character of the site.<br>
              1906-1907: Miran fort was first visited briefly by Aurel Stein on December 8, 1906, during his second expedition. A trial excavation of the fort (site number M.I.) uncovered eight rooms and over a hundred Tibetan woodslips. Stein returned on January 22, 1907, and carried out a thorough excavation of the fort, uncovering 44 rooms (site numbers M.I.i - M.I.xliv) discovering many more Tibetan woodslips and paper fragments, as well as other miscellaneous objects. He excavated other sites in the area, mainly to the north and west of the fort (site numbers M.II - M.X), including several temples containing well-preserved Buddhist frescoes and stucco images. On his third expedition, Stein returned to Miran on January 16, 1914, excavating other sites in the area (site numbers M.XI - M.XV), which were ruins of stupas and towers. The objects found in these included more stucco images and wooden carved objects. (Page references for main site discussion in Stein’s archaeological reports: Stein 1921, pp. 450-547.<br>
              1902 and 1910: Count Kozui Otani sent missions from Kyoto to some Taklamakan sites, among them Miran, to bring back Buddhist texts, wall paintings and sculptures. Were suspected by the British of espionage under cover of archaeology. (Sugiyama, Jiro. Central Asian Objects brought back by the Otani Mission, Tokyo National Museum, 1971).<br>
              1914: Stein returned to Miran on his third expedition. He lamented the destruction caused by the Otani missions’ highly unprofessional manner in which findings were removed. He excavated more material from Miran Fort, including more Tibetan woodslips and paper manuscripts.<br>
              1957–1958: Professor Huang Wenbi of the Institute of Archaeology, Academy of Social Sciences, toured Xinjiang and conducted preliminary surveys of major sites. He spent only a few days in Miran and recovered some objects from the Tibetan fort (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Huang_1983: 50-51</a>).<br>
              1973: Archaeological team from Xinjiang Museum. with Beijing archaeologist Chen Ge, mapped the 1st century canal system at Miran and undertook a fundamental survey of the site.<br>
              1978-1980: Huang Xiaojiang and Zhang Ping of the Xinjiang Museum visited Miran several times and conducted further work to supplement the 1973 survey. In addition to the Tibetan fort, they surveyed eight stupas, three temples and two beacon towers.<br>
              1989: Christa Paula visited Miran and discovered four structures not documented by Stein (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

            <span class="notheader">4: History of the collections</span><br>
              Elseworth Huntington brought a few objects back from Central Asia, most of which are now kept at the Yale University Library.<br>
              Aurel Stein's excavations provide the vast majority of the material from Miran. Stein's material was divided between London (the British Museum and the India Office Library) and India, whose government had provided co-sponsorship for his expeditions. By 1982, the majority of the London manuscripts were transferred to the British Library, which now holds all of Stein's finds of Tibetan woodslips and paper manuscripts from Miran. The British Museum holds the sculptures and other artefacts. The artefacts sent to India are now mainly in the National Museum, New Delhi. The collection of several hundred Stein textiles is on loan to the Victorian and Albert Museum, London.<br>
              The objects and manuscripts taken by the Otani expedition are now scattered over several locations in Japan and elsewhere.<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">5: Current state of the site</span><br>
            Access to the site is currently possible but restricted. There have been no major excavations of the site since Aurel Stein's third expedition.<br>

            <span class="notheader">1: General Introduction</span><br>
              The Niya archaeological site is approximately 50 miles north of modern Niya on the southern arm of the old Silk Road. Niya was one of the largest city oases on the Southern Silk Road, with an area of about 45 sq. km. More than 40 ancient structures were been identified by Stein during his three expeditions, and a further 30 buildings and two graveyards by a Sino-Japanese team since 1993. The sites are scattered along the ancient Niya river, extending about 25 km north to south and 7 km east to west. The structures found at the site include many houses and orchards, a stupa, two recently excavated Buddhist temples, and a cemetary.<br>
              Archaeological finds at the site include hundreds of wooden tablets inscribed in the rare Kharoshthi script and several official Kharoshthi documents on leather, a large carved wooden chair or altar, a dozen wooden tablets with Chinese characters, several wooden beams, ceramics, lacquerwork pieces, coloured silk cloths and coins.<br>
              Alternative names: The city was known as Caḍota to its inhabitants. It is also referred to as Niña in a Kharosthi document, and Nijiang in Xuanzang’s account, though this may not refer to ancient Niya but to a settlement between Mazar and today’s Minfeng that is still called ‘Niya’ today (both quoted in Stein, 1907, p. 311). Modern Chinese name: Minfeng<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">2: History of the site</span><br>
              In pre-historical times the Lop Nor region, of which Niya is a part, was occupied by a people of possibly Indo-European origin. By the end of the first millenium BC, it was part of the Shanshan empire. During much of the Han Dynasty, the whole region was under Chinese control. During the second century AD it came under the influence of the Kushan Empire, which may have accelerated the spread of Buddhist art and literature in the area. By the third century, there were Buddhist monasteries throughout the Shanshan empire. The paintings and sculptures found in Niya are somewhat later than those found in Miran, dating to the third and fourth centuries AD. They show the strong influence of the Gandharan art of the Kushans. Niya was abandoned by the fifth century.<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">3: History of exploration of the site</span><br>
              1900-1901: Niya was excavated on Stein’s first expedition. He was the first European to reach the site.<br>
              1902 and 1908: Count Kozui Otani sent missions from Kyoto to some Taklamakan sites to bring back Buddhist texts, wall paintings and sculptures. Carried out excavations at Niya. Were suspected by the British of espionage under cover of archaeology. (Sugiyama, Jiro. Central Asian Objects brought back by the Otani Mission, Tokyo National Museum, 1971).<br>
              1905: Ellsworth Huntington, an American geologist, visited the oasis without making any excavations.<br>
              1906: Stein returned to Niya for renewed excavations on his second expedition.<br>
              1913: Stein once more had chance to visit Niya.<br>
              1935: Peter Fleming on his travel from Peking to Kashmir visited Niya (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Fleming_1936: 282-284</a>).<br>
              1959: Shi Shuqing investigated the remains of stupas. Li Yuchun and others carried ut excavations in the area.<br>
              1980: Remote-sense archaeological investigation by the Xinjiang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology.<br>
              1988 ongoing: Excavations by the Sino-Japanese Joint Research Group have unearthed previously undiscovered ruins.<br>
              1989: Christa Paula visited Niya (Minfeng) on her way to Miran (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return
                false;">Paula_1994: 113-115</a>).<br>
              1998: Christoph Baumer visited the site and photographed several structures and artefacts (Baumer_2000).<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">4: History of the collections</span><br>
              Aurel Stein's excavations provide the vast majority of the material from Niya. Stein's material was divided between London (the British Museum and the India Office Library) and India, whose government had provided co-sponsorship for his expeditions. By 1982, the majority of the London manuscripts were transferred to the British Library, which now holds all of Stein's finds of Tibetan woodslips and paper manuscripts from Miran. The British Museum holds the sculptures and other artefacts. The artefacts sent to India are now mainly in the National Museum, New Delhi. The collection of several hundred Stein textiles is on loan to the Victorian and Albert Museum, London.<br>
              The objects and manuscripts taken by the Otani expedition are now scattered over several locations in Japan and elsewhere.<br>
              Elseworth Huntington brought a few objects back from Central Asia, most of which are now kept at the Yale University Library.<br>

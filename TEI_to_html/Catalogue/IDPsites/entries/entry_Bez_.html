              Bezeklik is a Buddhist cave site in a canyon north-east of the ancient Uighur city of Karakhoja/Kocho, and 50 km east of present-day Turfan (fig. 1). The 100 or more excavated caves and stone-built temples with domes were constructed between the 5th and 14th centuries. They were decorated with murals and statues, like the caves at Dunhuang. Most were Buddhist and many depict the Uighur donors, but there are also some rare Manichaean murals.<br>

With the sad proofs of progressive damage before my eyes, I could feel no doubt that, as local protection was out of the question, careful removal of as much of these mural paintings as circumstances would permit and artistic or iconographical interest would warrant, offered the only means of assuring their security.’ (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

For example, Photo 392/29(193) shows the east wall of Temple 9 with the lower half missing and the two bodhisattvas left above the removed painting both defaced. Photo 293/29(197) and (199) show the west wall of Temple 4 with a Buddha and bodhisattvas, all defaced and later removed by Stein (Andrews_1948: Pls. XV and XVI, fig. 2).<br>Although Bezeklik received other foreign visitors after Stein, as far as we have been able to ascertain, Stein was the last to remove paintings from the site.<br>
            <span class="notheader">4: History of the collections</span><br>
              Klementz and Oldenburg’s finds and expedition notes and photographs were sent directly from Xinjiang overland to Museums in St. Petersburg. Both published expedition reports with sections on Bezeklik (Klementz_1899 and Oldenburg_1914). These are in German and Russian respectively and have not been translated.<br>
              Klementz’s papers and archives were later transferred to what is now the Institute of Oriental Studies, St. Petersburg Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, while Oldenburg’s are in the archives of the Academy of Sciences itself (he became an Academician). Their non-manuscript finds and photographs are now in the State Hermitage Museum, although I have been unable to confirm that the Hermitage has all of the wall paintings and inscriptions listed by Klementz and it is possible that these are still in the Museum of Ethnography or elsewhere. One piece is on display in the Hermitage. Many of the Hermitage’s collections were evacuated by train during the Second World War but not all could be moved in time and others, although protected by staff who remained during the blockade, were damaged. These included the complete pranidhi painting from Temple 4. In 1953-4 it was restored but the gypsum slabs were not removed and deterioration of the plaster layer continued. A programme of conservation of the Turfan material began in 1999 and in May 2002 this piece went on display (http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/04/b2003/hm4_1_27.html).<br>
              Grunwedel and Le Coq’s finds were sent overland to Berlin and, in 1926 following conservation, were on permanent display at the Ethnological Museum, the larger pieces fixed to walls of the gallery (fig. 4). By 1928 there were 27 large rooms devoted to this material. Both men published detailed expedition reports within a few years of their return (Grunwedel_1912 and Le Coq_1913). In addition, their expedition notes, photographs, drawings and plans were all archived. Grunwedel’s report reproduced his detailed plans of the site and a description of each cave, along with a selection of photographs. Le Coq’s contained a very detailed description of Temple 9 including large format and very high quality colour and black and white lithographs of the pranidhi scenes.<br>
              In 1934 with the threat of war, lists started to be made categorizing the material and in 1938 much was moved into cellars and air raid shelters in Berlin. In 1944 the collections were moved to salt mines throughout Germany. However, the large paintings fixed to the walls could not easily be removed. They were therefore protected with sandbags and prayers. These were ineffective as the Museum, in the centre of the city, was bombed and the paintings destroyed. Only fragments were retrievable (Yaldiz_2000).<br>
              After the war the collections dispersed for safekeeping were recalled to Berlin and were transferred to the Museum für Indische Kunst in Berlin-Dahlem to the southwest of the city in 1963. The new building was inaugurated in 1971 and the galleries refurbished in 1998. Some of the material was displayed in a exhibition in New York (Hartel_1982). More than 2,000 accession numbers are unaccounted for, probably having been taken by Soviet troops on their withdrawal from Germany. One large batch was presented to the Grassi Museum in Leipzig in 1978 by the Soviets and, following Germany’s reunification, 55,000 objects were returned to Berlin. These included several hundred items from the Museum but 1562 items from the Central Asian collections were still missing, including about 100 pieces from Bezeklik (MIK_2002). In autumn 2002 the Director of the Museum was invited to the Hermitage to look at crates of material and, from preliminary investigation, identified 294 pieces from the Turfan collection. Central to this ‘treasure-hunt’ are the original records. As Yaldiz writes:<br>
              In 2002 the catalogue of art objects lost in and after World War II was finally completed after several years of intense investigation. Although there were numerous sources, the research involved many difficulties because much of the information in the card indexes and in the inventory books was incomplete. Irreplaceable aids for identification were the original glass plates which remain part of the Museum’s photographic archive. Every clue on the identification of the lost objects was taken into consideration however little information it might offer. (Yaldiz_2005)<br>
              Not only has the original documentation proved invaluable in restoring the collection to Berlin and in identifying the extant of the losses, but also in 'reconstructing' the caves at Bezeklik, as discussed below. Some other material from Germany was dispersed elsewhere, including a banner fragment from Bezeklik which Le Coq sold and which is now in Yale University Art Gallery (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return

              The Japanese collections were returned to Kyoto but were soon dispersed after Otani resigned as Abbot of Nishi Honganji in 1914. Unlike the other expeditions, the Japanese monk-explorers were privately funded by Otani and so the finds were not deposited in public collections. Although by 1926 the first expedition material was in the Imperial Gift Museum of Kyoto, by 1944 these items were in the hands of the private collector Teizo Kimura. The Japanese Government had to repurchase them after the war and, along with some other items bought from other individuals, the collection was deposited in the Oriental Section of Tokyo National Museum, where it remains today. This includes some of the Bezeklik paintings.<br>
              A large part of Otani’s second and third expedition material were kept in his house and sold along with the house in 1916. The buyer, Fusanoske Kuhara, was a friend of Masatake Terauchi, Governor-General of Korea (annexed by Japan in 1910). He presented the collection to his friend who kept it in the Museum of the Governor-General, which later became the National Central Museum in Seoul. It remains here today and also includes a number of the Bezeklik paintings.<br>
              Some of Otani’s papers, which included documentation from his expeditions, and his expedition photographs were given to Ryukoku University and are kept in the Library. The photographs and papers have been catalogued and are available via the Library catalogue. Some items have been on display at various exhibitions.<br>
              The wall paintings acquired by Stein on his third expedition were sent directly to Lahore, where they were acquisitioned. Stein directed the design of cases to house them in three large galleries, called the Central-Asian Antiquities Museum, although part of the Archaeological Survey of India. By 1937, following conservation, they were on display and remained here until 1991. They were suffering from ‘flaking and bulging’ because of the damp in the building which was subsequently demolished (Singh_1996: 57). They were moved to the National Museum, New Delhi, which had been built in 1961 and housed the rest of the Stein collections. However, they were kept in storage in galleries originally designed to display them. Since then further conservation work has been carried out in the Museum but as of 2005 they are still not on display.<br>
              Stein wrote published a detailed expedition report in 1928. His photographs and papers were later deposited in various institutions, the largest part of the former are now in the British Library, and of the latter in the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford. The Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences also has substantial collections (Falconer_2002). Many of the painting from Bezeklik were published in 1948 with large-scale prints, some in colour (Andrews_1948).<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">5: Current state of the site</span><br>
              The site of Bezeklik is easily accessible from Turfan. There is an entrance fee. Photographs are not allowed inside the caves.<br>

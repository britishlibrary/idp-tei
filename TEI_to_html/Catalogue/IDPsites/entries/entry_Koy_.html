            The site of Koyumal is a small ruined enclosure standing on a bare, gravel-covered alluvial plain. It remains unclear as to whether this was intended as a square or as an oblong. Near its centre rise the remains of a Stupa base. On the west stood a few ruined chapels. The debris on the floor of these chapels contained fragments, which had formed part of a large floral background in the mural decoration. Most of the fragments show lotus-petal or acanthus-like imbrications. According to Stein, the evidence seems to suggest that the site was occupied during early Tang tmes.<br>

            <span class="notheader">1: General Introduction</span><br>
              Astana is a large cemetery site 37 km southeast of present-day Turfan. It served as the cemetery for the descendents of Chinese settlers in Gaochang/Karakhoja. The 400 or more excavated tombs date from the 4th century to the first half of the 8th century. Desiccated bodies were preserved in the graves and are now on display in museums at Turfan and Urumqi. Numerous tomb objects such as pots, clothes, and tomb guardians have also been found.<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">2: History of the site</span><br>
              At the start of the first millennium this area was occupied by the Cheshi who offered allegiance to the Chinese Han court. According to the Chinese histories, the Shiji and Hanshu, the original inhabitants east of the Tianshan range from prehistoric times to the beginning of the first millennium AD, the Cheshi were a people who 'lived in felt-tents, kept moving in pursuit of water and grass for grazing, and had a fair knowledge of farming.' The Chinese rulers divided their territory in 60 BC and stationed a garrison and military colony there. Until AD 450 the main city was Jiaohe/Yarkhoto, west of present-day Turfan. At times the Chinese lost control to the Xiongnu and also withdrew when control in central China broke down. In the early 4th century an alternative commandery was established in Gaochang/Karakhoja to the east of present-day Turfan, and this area also fell in and out of Chinese and steppe control over the following centuries.<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">3: History of exploration of the site</span><br>
              Klementz (1897-8)<br>
              Klementz secured rubbings in Old Turkish (Uighur?) scratched in the walls of some of the cave-dwellings, as well as original fragments of stucco from the cave cells.<br>
              Kokhanovsky (1906-7)<br>
              Oldenburg (1909-10): Oldenburg was a prominent Russian linguist and Indologist who excavated at Astana.<br>
              Grünwedel/Huth (Nov 1902-March 1903; 1905-07 with Le Coq) Turfan oasis and Le Coq (between September 1904–December 1907 and 1913-4)<br>
              Otani (1902)<br>
              Le Coq (1905)<br>
              Stein (1907, 1914, 1915)<br>
              Stein first came to Astana in 1907, then returned for longer in December 1914. He discovered that the Astana cemetery belonged to the early Tang period when Gaochang was an important administrative centre and garrison of the Chinese-administered region.<br>
              On his 3rd expedition, Stein spent a fortnight here from January 18, 1915, an account of which is published in Innermost Asia.<br>
              Stein found many of the tombs had already been plundered. Stein excavated these tombs and found items of clothing, as well as fragments of documents, clay horses, and tomb guardians, and paintings (which Stein believed represent the central school of Chinese painting as it was in the early 8th century). The discoveries of textiles and silk have shed much light on the customs and crafts of the time. Stein surmises that the uniformity of the structural features in the tombs goes some way to prove that the burials in different portions of the cemetery probably took place during approximately the same period as that indicated by the range of dates found in the inscriptions and documents.<br>
              Non-Chinese documents that he found included two fragments of paper in Brahmi script and probably Kuchean language.<br>
              Mannerheim (1927-35) passed through Astana on 30 September 1907.<br>
              Chinese expeditions (1959-1975)<br>
              The Xinjiang Museum undertook 13 excavations at the Astana and Karakhoja graveyards, unearthing 456 tombs, 205 of which contained manuscript fragments. Most of these fragments were originally part of funerary objects – paper shoes, paper hats, paper belts, paper coffins - made from discarded documents.<br>
              Chinese excavations:<br>
              1959 excavations (carried out by Eastern Xinjiang working group of Xinjiang Museum in October/November): unearthed 4th to 7th century materials from 6 tombs. All 6 tombs contained dated documents. The tomb shapes remain the same from the 4th to 7th centuries.<br>
              1963-1965 excavations: 42 tombs unearthed and cleared. Chinese documents and textiles discovered.<br>
              From 1966-1969, 4 excavations made of 105 tombs, unearthing over a thousand objects. Household objects such as flasks, pots, bowls, plates, cans/boxes were found.<br>
              In 1967, archaeologists excavated tomb number 363.<br>
              During the 1972-1973 clean-up excavation, much valuable material was unearthed. Among this were documents, silk, thread, hemp, cotton, wool, scroll paintings, murals, colour clay sculptures, pottery, wooden and iron objects, and a small amount of lacquerware, as well as nuts and flour-based cakes.<br>
              The 1975 excavations unearthed nearly 500 objects. The tombs excavated this time mainly belonged to the Zhang, Jia and Song families.<br>
              The Xinjiang museum holds a range of objects excavated at Astana including China’s oldest sketch drawing painting on paper, wooden figurines, embroidered shoes, ox and cart, a stele, tapestry, goblets, clay figurines, documents in Chinese, Sogdian; female figurines working and dancing.<br>
            
            <span class="notheader">4: History of the collections</span><br>
              Both the Klementz and Oldenburg collections were originally deposited in the Asiatic Museum of St. Petersburg. Later the manuscripts in the Klementz and Oldenburg collections were transferred to the St Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences.<br>
              Klementz visited Astana (as well as Karakhoja/Gaochang, and Yarkhoto/Jiaohe). He examined the Buddhist caves (at Bezeklik), took some of the murals, and some manuscripts in Chinese and Sanskrit, and lots of photographs.<br>
              The Japanese collections were returned to Kyoto but were soon dispersed after Otani resigned as Abbot of Nishi Honganji in 1914. Unlike the other expeditions, the Japanese monk-explorers were privately funded by Otani and so the finds were not deposited in public collections. Although by 1926 the first expedition material was in the Imperial Gift Museum of Kyoto, by 1944 these items were in the hands of the private collector Teizo Kimura. The Japanese Government had to repurchase them after the war and, along with some other items bought from other individuals, the collection was deposited in the Oriental Section of Tokyo National Museum, where it remains today.<br>
              A large part of Otani’s second and third expedition material were kept in his house and sold along with the house in 1916. The buyer, Fusanoske Kuhara, was a friend of Masatake Terauchi, Governor-General of Korea (annexed by Japan in 1910). He presented the collection to his friend who kept it in the Museum of the Governor-General, which later became the National Central Museum in Seoul.<br>
              Some of Otani’s papers, which included documentation from his expeditions, and his expedition photographs were given to Ryukoku University and are kept in the Library. The photographs and papers have been catalogued and are available via the Library catalogue. Some items have been on display at various exhibitions.<br>

            The Domoko oasis north of Khotan was visited by Stein during his 1st, 2nd and 3rd expeditions. Items with this site no. were brought from Uzun-tati in the Domoko region during Stein's 1st expedition, and from various ruined sites near Domoko during Stein 3rd expedition. During the 2nd expedition, those items given the site no. 'Do.' were brought (by an unspecified person) from sites around Domoko, some probably from Khadalik. During the 3rd expedition, those items given the site nos. 'D.K.', 'Dom.' or 'Domoko.' were brought from sites around Domoko by Badruddin Khan.<br>

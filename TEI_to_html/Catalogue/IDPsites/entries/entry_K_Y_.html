            SAt the site of Karayantak, Stein found remains of a completely destroyed Buddhist shrine, similar to that at Khadalik in plan and decoration, but smaller. There were small pieces of painted wood from posts with no sign of destruction by fire. Apart from pieces of frescoed wall plaster, showing small, seated Buddha figures as part of a large vesica, nothing remained of cella walls, which probably had been built out of timber and wattle.<br>

            This site has altogether about 30 Chinese homesteads. The existence of the Nanhu oasis, in ancient as in modern times, is due solely to the water supply which this drainage-bed assures. In Stein’s day, this was mainly subterraneous, coming to the surface in the form of springs. The only conspicuous remains of antiquity which survive in the basin of Nanhu are the ruins of a small walled town. These broken walls form the shape of an irregular triangle. The wall proper was of solid construction, built with carefully stamped layers of clay, seeming of an early date.<br>
            Stein found fragments of wuzhu coins of Han and Tang dynasties. Pottery fragments were found, one of which had the smoky grey ‘mat-marked’ surface characteristic of the coarse pottery of the Han dynasty prevailing along the Limes. Everywhere bare patches of clay that appear between the dunes are abundantly covered with small debris of hard materials, such as pottery, stones, glass, metal etc.<br>
            The site of Nanhu might be associated with Yangguan of the Han period. A few kilometres north-east of the site was a ruined watchtower. The tower was clearly old in structure and built in pise. An embankment nearby was intended to serve as a guiding line for travellers when crossing the bare gravel plateau, to and from banks of Tang river. It was intended to offer protection from the severe gales. This could account for the local name given to the embankment by local people, Feng qiang 風牆, ‘wind wall’. Stein argues against the view that the embankment was used as a defensive ‘wall’.<br>
            The magnitude of this embankment shows that the population of Nanhu must have been far greater than in Stein’s day to merit the effort of extending such a structure 25km into the desert. Stein wonders whether Yangguan is the often referred to Yumenguan (Jade Gate Pass) in Chinese records. Certain statements in the Dunhuang Lu seem to point toward this view, although this remains uncertain.<br>

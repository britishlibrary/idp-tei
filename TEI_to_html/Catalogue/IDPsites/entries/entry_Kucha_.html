            Kucha is an important site mentioned in the Chinese annals under Qiuzi from Han to Tang times. Numerous remains attest to the flourishing conditions of Buddhist religious establishments and ample traces of the populations who maintained them, Bower came to the oasis of Kucha and bought one manuscript of 51 birch-bark leaves. These were eventually deciphered by Hoernle as containing seven distinct but incomplete texts, written in Sanskrit using the Brahmi alphabet, dealing with medicine and necromancy. Dating from around 5th century, probably written by Indian Buddhist monks, this proved to be one of the oldest written books. The publication of this find in Calcutta marks a new movement of archaeological exploration of Chinese Central Asia. (See British Collections)<br>
            Xuanzang passed through the region and left an account of life in Kucha. He spoke of the kingdom’s great size and of the luxuriance of its well-watered oases where corn and rice were grown.<br>

          <span class="notheader">Section: L.D.</span><br>This was a large dwelling about 4 km from the station L.A, evidently a farm built of Toghrak timber, with wattle walls of vertical tamarisk branches. The woodwork was badly decayed through rotting, but the tamarisk wattle of the walls survived to a height of about 30 cm, which helped indicate where the rooms would have been. Stein excavated few objects from this site. The most important among them were the wedge-shaped wooden cover-tablet, L.D.07, and the fragment of another L.D.04. Though bleached and perished by exposure, these fragments could be seen to belong to Kharosthi documents of the same type as found in considerable numbers at the Niya and L.A. sites. Their evidence indicates that the occupation of the dwelling was contemporary with that of the Loulan station. Apart from some wooden implements, the finds mainly comprised numerous small fragments of bronze ornaments, as well as beads of glass and stone.<br>

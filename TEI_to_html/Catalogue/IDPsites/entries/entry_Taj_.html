            To the west of the Muzart river, 30-35 miles WSW of Kucha on the northern arm of the Silk Road.(Innermost Asia map no. 17, A. 1).Stein found a well at the site of Tajik, next to which was a well-preserved guard post. The well contained reasonably fresh water. The presence of such subterranean drainage from the range explained both the ancient and modern occupation of such a barren spot.<br>
            Stein surveyed the ruins of Tajik, and those of Toghra-akin site to the west between April 24-27. At these ruins is a much dilapidated quadrangle, and the remains of a Buddhist sanctuary on a natural clay terrace at the mouth of the valley, and a group of small shrines scattered over low ridges higher up.<br>
            When the debris had been cleared completely, one of the apartments was seen to have a Buddhist shrine. There was a central niche for an image in its back wall. Traces of wall painting survived in the two arched passages leading into a room behind. In this same apartment (i) were found the stucco relief head of a Bodhisattva, and the wooden right hand which had probably belonged to the Buddha figure shown in Abhayamudra. A Chinese coin was found but could not be identified (now?).<br>
            In area iii, adjoining the shrine i, Stein discovered 3 small paper fragments with Kuchean writing. Shrine II.i had traces of painting on the passage walls. A small fragment of paper with Brahmi characters was recovered from the sand covering the floor. Also found was a well-preserved wooden tablet of the ‘Takhti’ shape, which was picked up under a slight layer of debris on the slope below this cave. It shows Kuchean writing divided into 3 sections, on recto and verso.<br>
            In view of scanty nature of finds, the main interest in Tajik lies in the evidence it supplies of the physical conditions of the region during the time when Buddhist cult was maintained, down to the Tang (AD 618-907).<br>
            P.816, on opposite side of the gorge, the top of steep hillock is occupied by the badly decayed remains of what appears to have been a large enclosure containing the monastic quarters. Due to the precipitous nature of the slopes, a great portion of the walls has slid down. No structural features were visible in the interior which was completely overlaid by rubbish heaps and pottery debris.<br>

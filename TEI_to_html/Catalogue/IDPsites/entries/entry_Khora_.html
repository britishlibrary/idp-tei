            In December 1907, Stein excavated at the site of Khora, where he found ruins of small Buddhist shrines scattered in groups over low but steep ridges. The site has a number of cellas, mostly quite small, to the northwest and southeast of the central structure. Three fragments of Brahmi Pothi leaves were said to have been found in this chamber. No coins or other datable objects were found at the site. Judging from the structural and other remains, it seems that its shrines continued to be worshipped as long as those of Ming-oi, suffering destruction about the same time as the latter. Such a site of worship would have had a larger agricultural settlement in its vicinity. If the water supply from the mountains had been more abundant than when Stein saw it, the clayey steppe to the east and north might have provided room for such a settlement. Desiccation was also an important factor<br>

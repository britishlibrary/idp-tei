      <p>"The Silk Road Project: Reuniting Turfan's Scattered Treasures" was a three-year project funded by the Henry Luce Foundation Inc. that brought together a team of twenty-five Chinese and American scholars working within the disciplines of archeology, history, art history, and religious studies.</p>
      <p>During the second year of the project (1997) four Chinese scholars (Deng Xiaonan, Rong Xinjiang, Wu Jianguo, and Zhang Guangda) compiled a Chinese-English database (using Microsoft Access 1997 and Twin Bridges software for Chinese) for the most important published materials from Turfan. The indexed materials concentrate on Chinese-language publications: they include the site reports of Huang Wenbi, the ten-volume set of documents Tulufan chutu wenshu (also available in four volumes with plates of the documents), the documents described in Klimkeit's Gnosis on the Silk Road (<a href="http://idp.bl.uk/database/bibliography.a4d?shortref=Klimkeit_1993" onClick="popUpII(this.href,'elastic',400,600,'bibliographywin');return false;">Klimkeit_1993</a>), the Kodansha/Wenwu joint publication of the Xinjiang Museum's holdings, and the brief archeological site reports published since 1949. The database is available at the project's <a href="http://research.yale.edu:8084/turfan/index.html">website</a>.</p>
      <p>An XML export of the database was kindly provided to IDP and converted into the XML format used by IDP in 2007.</p>

              Three frags. (Texts 622–624) bear the same site number M. I. xxxii.
                                5. h. According to Francke, they were once held together by red
                                cord. Now separated, they are apparently pieces of the same ms.
                                Texts 622 and 623 bear writing on both sides. Verso, consisting of
                                mantras, is written in the upright sutra style, and recto in a more
                                cursive style. For Text 624, only a few unconnected syllables, such
                                    assnaandshe, are legible on
                                verso, which apparently belong with the versos of Texts 622 and 623.
                                Recto writing seems faded. The three frags. cannot be joined
                                together. Since their relative position can be inferred, the
                                reconstructed text is given here. They also seem to belong to the
                                same ms. as Text 621.<br>

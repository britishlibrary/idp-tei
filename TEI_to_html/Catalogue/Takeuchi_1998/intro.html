    This is a catalogue of the Tibetan manuscripts in the Stein collection. In particular,
            it covers the paper manuscripts from Central Asian sites other than Dunhuang. Most of
            these manuscripts come from the Khotan and Lop-nor regions, and were gathered during all
            three of Stein's major Central Asian expeditions.

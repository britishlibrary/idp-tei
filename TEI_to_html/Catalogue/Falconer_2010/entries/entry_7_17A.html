                    This panorama of the lower enclosure of Bala Hissar shows the extent of demolition that the British undertook in the residential quarters that lay to the west of the palace. Intended to create a free-fire zone, a huge swathe of historic property was destroyed. The Charda Massom mosque complex, which survives to this day, can be seen on the left in the foreground.<br>

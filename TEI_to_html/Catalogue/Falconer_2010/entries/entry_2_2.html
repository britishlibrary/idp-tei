            <span class="bibit">JAMES RATTRAY, Interior of the Palace of Shah Shuja ool Moolk, late King of Cabaul, c. 1841–2.</span><br>
            
              
Rattray had first seen the interior of Shah Shuja’s palace in the Bala Hissar in Kabul during his brief reign between 1841–2. The original sketch for this illustration was made after Shah Shuja’s assassination, and the figure seated on the stone throne is in fact the wazir of one of Shah Shuja’s sons.

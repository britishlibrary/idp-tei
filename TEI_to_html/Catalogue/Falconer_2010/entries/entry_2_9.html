            <span class="bibit">JAMES RATTRAY, Afghaun foot soldiers in their winter dress, with entrance to the Valley of Urgundeh, 1842.</span><br>
            
              
			    Rattray describes how in 1842 the British met with considerable resistance from fighters at this rocky watchtower between the valleys of Maidan and Argandeh. A force of these ‘wild, unruly, merry fellows,’ was however raised for service with the British.

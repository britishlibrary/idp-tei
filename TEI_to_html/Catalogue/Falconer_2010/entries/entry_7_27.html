		    This panorama of Baghe Babur shows the historic graves in the far right, with mosque built by Shah Jahan below, and a clear indication of water channels running down the slope. Most of the mature chinar trees were cut down during the 1990s, but extensive re-planting has taken place since 2003.<br>

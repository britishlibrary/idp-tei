            <span class="bibit">JOHN BURKE, The Bala Hissar Gate, Kabul, 1879.</span><br>
            
              
                    Burkeâ€™s extensive documentation of the Bala Hissar provides a unique historical record of structures which in most cases no longer exist. The Darwaza Shah Shaheed, which was named after the nearby shrine and dates from the Mughal period, was the most elaborate of the gates leading into the citadel.<br>

            <span class="bibit">JAMES RATTRAY, Town and Citadel of Ghuznee, c. 1841-2.</span><br>
            
              
	Rattray’s view of Ghazni was made ‘near some musjeeds outside the Candahar gate, at the west side of the city.’ This is one of the last views of the citadel, with the walled city outside, before it was destroyed by the British, after its capture in September 1842.

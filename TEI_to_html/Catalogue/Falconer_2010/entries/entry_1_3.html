            <span class="bibit">CHARLES MASSON, Palace, Kabul, exterior view from the north, early 1830s.</span><br>
            
              
			    This drawing shows the residential quarters in the lower Bala Hissar, with the walls of the upper enclosure on the slope above. Although much altered over time, Masson suggests that the residential part of the palace that he saw in the 1830s had been constructed by Timur Shah in the 1750s, when he moved his capital from Qandahar to Kabul.

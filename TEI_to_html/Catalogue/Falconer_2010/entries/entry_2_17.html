Dating from December 1841, this view from the roof of the house of the Governor of Qandahar shows the dome of the mausoleum of Ahmad Shah Durrani on the left, with a mosque and the citadel to the right. In the foreground is a partly ruined caravanserai and the domes and vaults of the covered bazaar.

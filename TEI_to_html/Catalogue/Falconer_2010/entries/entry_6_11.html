                    The gardens at Nimla are thought to be the Baghe Wafa, or Garden of Fidelity, mentioned by Babur in his memoirs. The garden follows the traditional charbagh layout, and this photograph shows an avenue of plane trees, with traces of one of the Mughal water channels in the centre, and a marble cascade to the left. This garden was partly restored in the early 1990s.<br>

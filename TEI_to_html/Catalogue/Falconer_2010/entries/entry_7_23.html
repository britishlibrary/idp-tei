		    Timur Shah (1748–1793), the son of Ahmad Shah and the second ruler of the Durrani Empire, moved his capital from Qandahar to Kabul in 1776. Although he died in 1793, his mausoleum was not completed until 1817. This photograph shows how the building once stood in extensive gardens, with mature mulberry trees. Recently restored, the mausoleum is still one of the most impressive public buildings in Kabul.<br>

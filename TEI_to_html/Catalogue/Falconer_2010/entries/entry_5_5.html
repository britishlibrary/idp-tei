On his return to Afghanistan after the Ambala durbar, Sher Ali gave permission for the professional photographers Baker and Burke to take a further series of sixteen portraits of his entourage at Jamrud. This is one of several studies of Sher Ali, which became commercially available as a result of these sessions.<br>

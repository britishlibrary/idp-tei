            <span class="bibit">BAKER AND BURKE, Amir Shir Ali Khan at Jamrud, April 1869.</span><br>
            
              
On his return to Afghanistan after the Ambala durbar, Sher Ali gave permission for the professional photographers Baker and Burke to take a further series of sixteen portraits of his entourage at Jamrud. This is one of several studies of Sher Ali, which became commercially available as a result of these sessions.<br>

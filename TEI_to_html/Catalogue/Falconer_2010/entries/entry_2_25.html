			    Rattray’s view from Siah Sang shows the encampment of British troops in the plain of Chaman-i-Shah – now known as Chaman Uzuri – with the city of Kabul behind. The departure of British forces from Afghanistan in October 1842 ended what Rattray described as the long series of unparalleled disasters, reverses, crimes, and errors, which ended in our total annihilation.

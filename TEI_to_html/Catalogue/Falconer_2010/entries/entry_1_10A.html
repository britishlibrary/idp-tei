            <span class="bibit">CHARLES MASSON, Bedak in Koh Daman, 1833.</span><br>
            
              
			    This watercolour painting by Masson is one of a number of examples that Masson made from his original sketches. Although his draftsmanship was in general extremely accurate, in this case Masson has removed the small fortified enclosure seen in the foreground of the original drawing.

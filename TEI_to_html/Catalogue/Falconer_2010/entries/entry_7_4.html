		    In this view of Bala Hissar from the east, the Darwaza Shah Shaheed or Lahore gate is clearly visible in the centre left, with the upper section of the citadel behind. On the right can be seen the back of the palace, whose rooms were built along the walls of the outer enclosure. Apart from sections of walling to the east, there is today little trace of any these structures.<br>

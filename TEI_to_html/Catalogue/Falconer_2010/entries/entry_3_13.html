            <span class="bibit">JAMES ATKINSON, The main street in the bazaar at Cabaul in the fruit season, c. 1840.</span><br>
            
              
		      In this animated scene, Atkinson documents a busy part of the bazaar in Kabul. On the far right is a baker, with fruit-sellers on the left. The original watercolour from which this lithograph was made, does not appear to have survived.

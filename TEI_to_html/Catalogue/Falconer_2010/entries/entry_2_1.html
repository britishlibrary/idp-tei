	Rattray’s portrait of Dost Muhammad was made in Peshawar in January 1841, while the Amir was en route to exile in India after his overthrow by Shah Shuja. In this study, however, the artist has portrayed the Amir and his son in the audience hall in the citadel of Ghazni. On Shah Shuja’s death in 1842, Dost Muhammad returned to rule Afghanistan until his own death in 1863.

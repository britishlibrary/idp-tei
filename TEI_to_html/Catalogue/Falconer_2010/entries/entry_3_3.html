			    Travellers making their way up the narrow defile of Khord Kabul, which forms an important natural defence of Kabul from the east. The gorge had a particular significance for the British, who lost many men here during their retreat to India in 1841, and again in January 1842, when the British garrison was attacked as they made their way to Jalalabad.<br>

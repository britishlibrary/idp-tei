		    The Bala Burj, a tower built by the British on the site of a Buddhist stupa, lies at the extreme right of this panoramic view of Kabul city. On the left of the photo can be seen the dome of Timur Shah’s mausoleum, with the village of Deh Afghanan across the Kabul river to the west. In the background can be seen an extensive lagoon, in the area now known as Wazirabad.<br>

                    Taken from the Bala Burj, this photograph shows the massive stone walls and towers that protected the citadel to the west. The gate in the lower enclosure walls on the left was opened up by the British during their occupation, to give access to the heights of Sher Darwaza to the west. A lateral wall, visible on the right, seems also to have been built to restrict access through the saddle.<br>

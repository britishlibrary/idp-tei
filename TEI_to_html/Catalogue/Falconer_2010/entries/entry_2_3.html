            <span class="bibit">JAMES RATTRAY, Hawkers of Ko-i-Stan, with Valley of Caubul and mountains of Hindookoosh, c. 1841.</span><br>
            
              
			In his description of this portrait, Rattray notes that it was the custom for hawks that had been trained for hunting to be released at the end of each season, only to be re-captured and re-trained in subsequent years. The landscape on the left of this drawing resembles the Kabul valley.

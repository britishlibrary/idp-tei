		    This photograph looks along the Kabul River towards the Pul-i-Shah-do-Shamshara, a brick bridge constructed by Shah Jahan. Largely obscured by trees on the far bank stands one of the oldest mosques in Kabul, on the site of which now stands the Masjid-i-Shah-do-Shamshara, built by Amanullah Khan.<br>

		      This watercolour shows a column on British troops, including an elephant visible in the centre, heading down the valley of Maidan, where Atkinson described a ‘charming silver line of river flowing through its centre, and the trees, meadow, and plantations, always appearing bright and glowing’. To the right is what seems to be the ruins of the base of a brick minaret.

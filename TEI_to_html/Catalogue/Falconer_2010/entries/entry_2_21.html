This view of the bazaar and rooftops of Qandahar was made from the Nakkar Khana or musiciansâ€™ gallery, which was part of a domed structure or Chahar Suq at the intersection of the covered bazaars. On the left is the sanctuary of the Khirqa, where the cloak of the Prophet is kept, with part of the citadel on the right.

		      This idyllic scene shows the pools and channels through which water flowed down the garden laid out by Babur in the early 16th century, and in which he is buried. This system was reconstructed between 2003-8, along with extensive re-planting. Judging by the groups of visitors drawn by Atkinson, the garden was clearly as popular then as it remains today.

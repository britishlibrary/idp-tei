            <span class="bibit">JAMES ATKINSON, The fortress and citadel of Ghuznee and the two minars, 1838-41.</span><br>
            
              
	Like many other artists, Atkinson was drawn to the picturesque qualities of the imposing brick minarets outside Ghazni. Here, he shows them against a backdrop of the citadel and walled city, with a group of traders exchanging goods in the foreground.

            <span class="bibit">JOHN BURKE, The south face of the Upper Bala Hissar, Kabul, 1880.</span><br>
            
              
                    The section of defensive walls and towers along the south-west side of the Bala Hissar were in good condition at the time of Burkeâ€™s photo in 1880. While there has been deterioration in parts, this part of the Bala Hissar remains largely intact to this day.<br>

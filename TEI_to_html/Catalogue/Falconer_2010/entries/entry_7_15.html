                    This photograph shows the fine brickwork of the Darwaza Naqqara Khana at the north-west corner of the lower enclosure. Across a wide moat that ran around this part of the citadel lay the bazaars, mosques and homes of the city of Kabul. Although the line of the defensive walls can still be determined, the gate has long since disappeared.<br>

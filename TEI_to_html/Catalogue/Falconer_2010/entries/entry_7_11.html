                    An explosion in the arsenal in the Bala Hissar, where gun-powder and munitions were stored, caused major damage soon after the British re-occupied it. Fear of further explosions was one of the reasons for re-locating the British garrison to the Sherpur cantonment in late 1879.<br>

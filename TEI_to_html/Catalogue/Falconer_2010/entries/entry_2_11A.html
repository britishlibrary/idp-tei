		These two figures were part of a large number of guards and executioners in Shah Shuja’s retinue. The chief executioner, Muhammad Shah, is seated, and Rattray describes him as ‘a gentleman by birth, who rode before the sovereign. In his hand is the painted wand, surmounted by a bird, indicative of his being the head of a family.’

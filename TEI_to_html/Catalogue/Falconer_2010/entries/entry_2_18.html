            <span class="bibit">JAMES RATTRAY, Ladies of Caubul in their in and out-of-door costume, c. 1841-2.</span><br>
            
              
Rattrayâ€™s portrait contrasts the private dress of women at home in Kabul, with the modest costume for public places, shown on the figure to the right. The model here is seated in a space with plaster decoration that was typical of wealthy homes at the time.

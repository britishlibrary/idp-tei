		      This view shows the platform on which Babur’s grave stands, with a glimpse of the white marble mosque built by Shah Jahan in 1646 behind, shrouded in trees. Both the grave enclosure and mosque were restored between 2003-8. In the plain below the garden can be seen the fort of Nawab Jabar Khan, brother of Amir Dost Muhammad.

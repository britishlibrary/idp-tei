 This panorama from the lower slope of the Asmai hill clearly shows the extent of the charbagh garden that surrounded the mausoleum of Timur Shah. The large building facing it across the Kabul river, standing within a walled compound, has entirely disappeared. The densely-packed traditional homes of Deh Afghanan village can be seen in the foreground on the left.<br>

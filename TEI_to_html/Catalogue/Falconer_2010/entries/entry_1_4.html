            <span class="bibit">CHARLES MASSON, Interior of enclosure (marble) of Baburâ€™s tomb, Kabul, early 1830s.</span><br>
            
              
			    This drawing of the marble enclosure around the grave of Babur indicates the poor state of its repair at the time. In his account of the garden, Masson describes its cooling watercourses and shady orchards, which made it popular for visitors. The drawing was critical in enabling the reconstruction of the enclosure in 2006.

		      This watercolour was made by Emily Eden when Dost Muhammad was a guest of her brother, the Governor-General of India Lord Auckland, in June 1841. The other figures in the group are Haidar Khan, former Governor of Ghazni, Muhammad Akram Khan and Abdul Ghani Khan. This group portrait was later reproduced as a lithograph in Edenâ€™s Portraits of the princes and people of India (London: 1844).<br>

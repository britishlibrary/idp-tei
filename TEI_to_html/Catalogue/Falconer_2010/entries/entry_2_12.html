		‘Never was a wilder, more devil-may-care set of fellows seen’, according to Rattray, than the Afghan Cavalry raised by Shah Shuja, and also hired as levies by the British Army. In this portrait, we can see the smoking apparatus carried by such men – a pan of coals slung under the horse’s girths and a box for pipes at the saddle pommel.

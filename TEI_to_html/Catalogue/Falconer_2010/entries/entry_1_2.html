            <span class="bibit">CHARLES MASSON, Bala Hissar Citadel, Kabul, from the south, early 1830s.</span><br>
            
              This is one of several drawings that Masson made of Bala Hissar, and shows on the summit of the ridge Kulah-i-Firangi or ‘European’s Hat’, a pavilion-like structure that has since disappeared. The main gate to the lower citadel, Darwaza Shah Shaheed can be seen on the right of the drawing, with the Shah Shahid mausoleum outside of the walled enclosure.<br>

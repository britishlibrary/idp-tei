            <span class="bibit">JOHN BURKE, Jalalabad, the city and surroundings from the Kabul Gate, 1879.</span><br>
            
              
This view of Jalalabad taken from the Kabul gate shows the extent of orchards that lay inside the city. Having entered Jalalabad in late December 1878, British troops remained in occupation through the following year, during which time Burke spent time photographing the city and its surroundings.

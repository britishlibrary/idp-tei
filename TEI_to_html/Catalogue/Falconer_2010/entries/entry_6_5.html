		    In this gathering of tribal leaders at Jalalabad, Cavagnari is seen with William Jenkyns, a civil servant who attended the negotiations at Gandamak. Cavagnari was subsequently appointed British Resident at Kabul, and his murder there in September 1879 led to the resumption of hostilities. Jenkyns, who was Secretary to the Kabul Mission, also died in Kabul.

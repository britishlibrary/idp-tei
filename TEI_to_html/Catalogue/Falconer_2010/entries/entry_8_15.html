                    British forces handed over Kandahar to the Afghan authorities and began their departure on 15th April 1881. On the following day, Muhammad Hashim Khan, the new Governor appointed by the Amir, entered Qandahar. This portrait of the Governor and his staff was probably taken at around this date.<br>

            <span class="bibit">JAMES RATTRAY, Mosque of Goolaum Hoossein Huzrut-ji at Kandahar, c. 1841-2.</span><br>
            
              
The grave of Ghulam Hussain Hazratji, along with those of members of the royal family, stands in the courtyard of a richly-decorated mosque in Qandahar that also bears his name. To mark his importance, Hazratjiâ€™s grave measures some twenty-three feet in length, with tall marble stones at either end.

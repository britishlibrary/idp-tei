		    After the British invasion of Afghanistan in late 1878 and the death of Sher Ali in early 1879, his son and successor Yaqub Khan negotiated a treaty at Gandamak, which permitted the British to install an envoy in Kabul. These men, wearing the kilt of the Highlanders, formed the escort for the Amir at these talks.

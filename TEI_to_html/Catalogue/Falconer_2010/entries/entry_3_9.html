	This view of the city of Kabul was drawn from the heights of Tapa Maranjan, which was a burial site from Buddhist times. It illustrates how compact the city was in the 19th century, with extensive gardens and fields to the north. The dome of the mausoleum of Timur Shah can be seen on the far right.

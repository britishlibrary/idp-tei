            <span class="bibit">CHARLES MASSON, Little Koh-dowlah, a village of Koh-darah (the grass vale) in the Koh-I-daman (hill skirts) of Kabul, early 1833. </span><br>
            
              
			    After the rigours of the Kabul winter, many residents of Kabul visited the Paghman valley and Koh e Daman, north of Kabul, in the spring. In 1833 Masson visited both and made sketches of ‘the cluster of villages, castles, and orchards which spread before us.’ This drawing is of the village of Koh e Dawlah.

            <span class="bibit">CHARLES MASSON, Ghizni from the Kabul side, c. 1832.</span><br>
            
              
			    Massonâ€™s view of the citadel of Ghazni conveys the manner in which it dominates the surrounding plain. Capital of the Ghaznavid Empire until it was destroyed by the Ghorids in 1153, Masson was able to find little evidence of its former spendour during his visit.

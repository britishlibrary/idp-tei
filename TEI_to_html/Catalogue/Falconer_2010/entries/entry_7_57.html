            <span class="bibit">JOHN BURKE, Kafiristan slaves at Kabul, 1880. </span><br>
            
              
During 1878–80, Burke produced a series of portraits of occupational types, including these young boys from Kafiristan which, after the forced conversion of its people in the late 19th century, came to be known as Nuristan.

		      This painting shows Shah Shuja seated on the balcony of the durbar hall, receiving khans and officers of state, who are lined up with uniformed soldiers in the courtyard. To the right is the haremserai of the palace, and the defensive walls that ran along the ridge of the Sher Darwaza hill can be seen behind.

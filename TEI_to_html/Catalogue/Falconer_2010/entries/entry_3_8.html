	This watercolour provides a panorama of the city Kabul from the upper part of the Bala Hissar, with Shah Shuja’s palace and the royal mosque separated by gardens. Outside of the walled enclosure are the quarters of Baghe Ali Mardan and Asheqan wa Arefan, with Deh Afghanan beyond, on the west bank of the Kabul river.

		    After re-capturing the Afghan throne in 1868, Amir Sher Ali Khan sought to ally the country with Britain, in the face of growing Russian influence in Afghan affairs. This group portrait shows the British and Afghan participants at a durbar held in Ambala, with Sher Ali and Lord Mayo, the Viceroy of India in the centre. Sher Aliâ€™s son Abdullah Jan is to the right.<br>

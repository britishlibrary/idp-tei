            <span class="bibit">CHARLES MASSON, Balla Bagh, near Jallalabad, c. 1828.</span><br>
            
              
			    Masson’s drawing, which may have been made in 1828 during his first visit to Nangarhar, is of the walled town of Bala Bagh from across the Surkhab river. He described Bala Bagh as ‘more commercial’ than Jalalabad, with a better climate, large royal gardens and areas of extensive cultivation.

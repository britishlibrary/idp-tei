		    This view shows the grave of Babur on the right, while the grave of his great-aunt Ruqaya Sultana Begum in the foreground on the left. On the far right is the mosque built by Shah Jahan in 1676. Both the graves and the mosque were restored between 2003–8. It is instructive to compare this photograph with Atkinson’s watercolour of 1838.<br>

                    The Mussoorie Conference took place in an attempt to restore friendly relations between the two countries following the hostilities of 1919. The meeting was inconclusive and a treaty was only finally signed in Kabul in 1921. The chief Afghan negotiator was Mahmud Beg Tarzi (seated centre), the great nationalist and force for modernisation in the first half of the 20th century.<br>

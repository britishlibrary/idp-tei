		Rattrayâ€™s view from the heights above the village of Bemaru shows the British cantonment in Sherpur in the foreground. Beyond lies the city of Kabul, dominated by the fortifications of the Bala Hissar, with snow-capped mountains towards Logar in the distance. The graveyard shown on the right now lies in Wazir Akbar Khan.

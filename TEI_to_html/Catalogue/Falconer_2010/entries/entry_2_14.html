            <span class="bibit">JAMES RATTRAY, Hyder Khan, the Governor of Ghuznee, c. 1841.</span><br>
            
              
			  Ghulam Haidar Khan, the fourth son of Amir Dost Muhammad and Governor of Ghazni, was captured when the city fell to the British in 1839. Although Rattray met him in Peshawar in 1841, he did not have the opportunity to sketch him and this portrait is a copy of a painting by Lady Charlotte Keane, with the citadel of Ghazni and minarets inserted as appropriate background.<br>

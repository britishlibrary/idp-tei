	When Rattray visited the grave near Ghazni of Sultan Mahmud, the mausoleum was surrounded by a picturesque, peaceful garden. This view of the interior of mausoleum shows the heavy wooden doors that were subsequently removed and taken to Agra by the British, under the mistaken assumption that they had been looted from the Hindu temple at Somnath in India.

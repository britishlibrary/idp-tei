                    Following the Treaty of Gandamak, Sir Pierre Louis Cavagnari arrived in Kabul to take up his post as British Resident on 24th July 1879. Only a month later, the Residency was attacked by rebellious Afghan soldiers and all occupants killed. The damage caused to the Residency can be clearly seen on this photograph.<br>

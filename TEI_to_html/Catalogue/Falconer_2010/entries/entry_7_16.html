                    At the centre of the palace in the lower enclosure of the Bala Hissar lay an extensive formal garden or chaharbagh, on to which the audience hall opened. Behind this to the left are the residential quarters that were used by Shah Shuja in the early 1840s. The smaller complex to the far right is a palace used by Yaqub Khan.<br>

	In the text accompanying this lithograph, the interior of the palace in Qandahar is described as being adorned ‘with elaborate carving in wood, and has, like most houses of the rich, its walls plastered with stucco. It is of light summer house construction, and its courts are embellished with trees and fountains.’

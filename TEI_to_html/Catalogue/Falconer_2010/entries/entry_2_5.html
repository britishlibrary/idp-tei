            <span class="bibit">JAMES RATTRAY, Khoja Padshah, a Ko-i-Stan chief, with his armed retainers, c. 1841–2.</span><br>
            
              
	This portrait group of Kohistani chiefs, set against a background of a fort east of Kabul, was made by Rattray during a trip along the Panjshir river, close to Bagram. The figures in the group are from the escorts who accompanied them on a tour of forts and monuments in the area.<br>

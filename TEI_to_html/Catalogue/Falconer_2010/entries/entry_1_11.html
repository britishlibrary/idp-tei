            <span class="bibit">CHARLES MASSON, Portion of the caves and Second Idol, Bamiyan, 1832.</span><br>
            
              
			    Masson only made a few sketches of Bamiyan, during one brief visit. On the extreme left of this drawing is part of the large niche with an image of the standing Buddha, with the smaller image in the centre. Unconvinced that this was a Buddhist site, Masson suggested that the caves were royal burial places and that the ‘statues might represent sovereigns or the deities they adored.’

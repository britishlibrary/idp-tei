            <span class="bibit">JAMES RATTRAY, Ko-i-Staun foot soldiery in summer costume. Actively employed among the rocks, c. 1841–2.</span><br>
            
              
			    The principal figure in this drawing is identified by Rattray as fighter by the name of Mir Alum. Carrying a traditional firearm or jezail, which they used with great accuracy from positions on rocky outcrops, marksmen like Mir Alum were able to control the passes that led through gorges and valleys below.

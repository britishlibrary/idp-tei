			  This drawing shows Minar-i-Chakari, a tall stone tower thought to date from the 7â€“9th centuries that stood high above the Kabul plain at the summit of a pass to Logar. Probably a marker for caravans crossing the valley, rather than a minaret, as its modern name implies, the tower collapsed during a violent thunderstorm in 1996.

                                volume popular account of his First Central Asian expedition
                                (1900-01) written by M. Aurel Stein and published in 1903 by T.
                                Fischer Unwin in London. Stein mainly wrote the manuscript in
                                England during leave from his post in India in 1903. It was then
                                checked by two friends before being passed on to the publishers.<br>This object biography looks at the story of the original manuscript of
                                the book, which is now in the Library of the Hungarian Academy of
                                Sciences. The manuscript is bound in two leather volumes. It is in
                                Stein’s original pagination, Vol.1.: 434 ff. and Vol. 2.: 435-812
                                ff., marked as completed in London, 6 February 1903. Bound at the
                                end of the second volume there are also two sections from Stein’s
                                diary written during his return journey to Europe from his First
                                Expedition, namely from Osh, dated 8 Jun 1901 (13 ff.) and
                                Samarkand, dated 15 Jun 1901 (6 ff.). The volumes also contain dried
                                flowers, probably picked by Stein during his periods at his summer
                                camp in Mohand Marg in Kashmir. The stories of each of these
                                elements form part of this biography.<br>The story starts with Stein’s First Expedition between 1900-01, where
                                he collected the notes, maps, plans and photographs later used in
                                his book. On his return to Europe in 1901 he stops in Osh and
                                Samarkand, making extensive diary entries in each place, before
                                returning across Eurasia by train and steamer. In 1903 in London he
                                finishes the original manuscript and after publication of the book,
                                probably packs it up the with his diaries and the rest of his papers
                                for return by ship to Bombay and from there to his home in Lahore,
                                then in British India.<br>In India, the manuscript was later bound into two leather volumes,
                                combined with sections of Stein’s travel diary. He probably took the
                                volumes with him to Mohand Marg in Kashmir, where he spent many
                                summers writing and researching. Photographs of his summer camp
                                there always show vases of flowers on his desk. He also placed
                                flowers in his books to be pressed, and some are found in these two
                                volumes. Later he packed the volumes away with many of his
                                books.<br>During 1922 Stein spent the winter in a friend’s bungalow in Kashmir,
                                Almond Cottage, sorting through boxes of books from storage. He made
                                a list of books he planned to present to the Library of the
                                Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest. This was the town of his
                                birth and childhood and he had used the library as a young scholar:
                                the Hungarian Academy of Sciences is on the River Danube, just
                                around the corner from Stein’s birthplace. The Academy had been the
                                first among the scholarly bodies of the world to elect Stein as a
                                member in 1895.<br>Stein’s gift to the Academy consisted of about two thousand books on
                                India, Central Asian philology and archaeology, along with the two
                                volumes of the bound manuscript, and other manuscripts and papers.
                                They initially travelled with him from India to Port Dais. Here
                                Stein caught a train for Cairo and then went on a tour of the Near
                                East and Egypt before arriving in Budapest in 5th May 1924. His
                                eight boxes of books continued on by ship (to Venice) and train (via
                                Trieste) without him and they arrived in the Library in Budapest in
                                March 1924. The two volumes of the manuscript were acquisitioned
                                into the Library’s collections in autumn 1925 with the pressmark No.
                                653/1-2.<br>This was Stein’s first donation of books to the Library of the
                                Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In his will, he gave all his printed
                                books, part of his manuscripts, photographs (about 7000 prints, the
                                most comprehensive collection of the 1900-1901 expedition), maps,
                                impressions of inscriptions, and letters to the Academy.<br>Stein’s collections of photographs and manuscripts were catalogued by
                                a joint Hungarian-British team of scholars during 1998-2001 and the
                                resulting Catalogue of the Collections of Sir Aurel Stein was
                                published by the Academy in 2002. The manuscript was given the
                                catalogue number, Stein 25.<br>The book which resulted from the manuscript sold very quickly, with
                                500 copies (two thirds fo the print run) being sold by September
                                1903. Stein bought the printing blocks – and therefore the rights –
                                from the publisher for 24 shillings and arranged for republication
                                in a more affordable edition by the London publishers Hurst and
                                Blackett in 1904.<br>It was translated by Gyula Halász into Hungarian and published as<span class="bibit">Homokba temetett városok: régészeti és

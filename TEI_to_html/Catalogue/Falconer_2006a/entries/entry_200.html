              PUBLISHED: 'Ruins of Desert Cathay', vol. 1, pl. 107: ''Darstarkhan' offered on desert route to Charchan. On left Chiang-ssu-yeh and my caravan-men enjoying the treat brought by Beg from Charchan.' This photograph does not appear to be listed in Stein's negative notebook, but the date can be computed from Stein's narrative:

'Next morning I had scarcely covered five miles when a big cavalcade met us to offer welcome. It was Sidik Beg of Charchan, with a posse of local notables, and four sturdy Pathan traders who were temporarily settled at the oasis, and eagerly asserted their right to share in the reception of 'Sahib' from their own land...They were accustomed to take small caravans with Indian goods from Khotan via Charklik to Karashahr and on to Turfan in the north-east, and had found Charchan a convenient half-way station on their ventures. They had much needed information to give about routes, distances, supplies, and the like. But there was little chance for quenching my thirst for such practical knowledge, until a big Dastarkhan, brought up by the Beg's people, including meat dishes and dried fruits, had been duly disposed of by the joint efforts of my hosts and my own men who had long missed such rich fare.'

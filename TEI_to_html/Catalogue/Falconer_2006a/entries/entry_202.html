              Very poor quality image.

'The 'Tim', found quite close to where we had crossed [the Charchan River] and only some hundreds of yards off the river-bank, proved to be the ruin of a small square structure in solid masonry which in all probability had served as a stupa base. The extant portion was only eleven feet long, standing at a height of about seven feet above the present ground level. The great size of the bricks and their careful setting attested the antiquity of the structure. Its interest lies in the fact that it proves the existence of a pre-Muhammadan settlement in the immediate vicinity of the present river course, and thus supports the presumption that the latter has changed less in its main direction than the many dry branches and lagoons met with on either side might otherwise lead on to suppose.'

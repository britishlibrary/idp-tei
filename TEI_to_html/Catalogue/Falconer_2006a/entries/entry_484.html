              View from south-east. 'In a broad, gravel-strewn depression descending from Togucha south towards the oasis of Lapchuk, I surveyed a number of small ruined shrines. These evidently belonged to the later Buddhist times, which, as attested by a record of Prince Shah Rukh's envoy to the Chinese Emperor, extended at Hami as well as at Turfan down to the very end of the fourteenth century. Neither these ruins nor the remains of a small ruined town at the northern end of the Lapchuk oasis seemed promising enough to justify the sacrifice of time needed for their clearing.' ('Ruins of Desert Cathay', vol. 2, p. 351).

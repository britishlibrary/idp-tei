              This paper presents an analysis of the star atlas included in the
                                medieval Chinese manuscript Or.8210/S.3326 discovered in 1907 by the
                                archaeologist Aurel Stein at the Silk Road town of Dunhuang and now
                                housed in the British Library. Although partially studied by a few
                                Chinese scholars, it has never been fully displayed and discussed in
                                the Western world. This set of sky maps (12 hour-angle maps in
                                quasi-cylindrical projection and a circumpolar map in azimuthal
                                projection), displaying the full sky visible from the Northern
                                Hemisphere, is up to now the oldest complete preserved star atlas
                                known from any civilisation. It is also the earliest known pictorial
                                representation of the quasi-totality of Chinese constellations.<a href="/education/astronomy_researchers/index.a4d" target="_blank">Full article

      <p>This electonic version of Lionel Giles' catalogue is a work in progress, and so far

      <p>* (asterisk) (before title) – indicates
                start of the text in question is missing</p>
      <p>* (asterisk) (after title) –
                indicates that text is incomplete or the end missing</p>
      <p>[ ] (square brackets)
                (around title) – indicates that the title is not found on the manuscript
                itself</p>
      <p>Mtd. – mutilated</p>
      <p>Begin. – beginning</p>
      <p>MS. – manuscript, but
                generally refers here to handwriting. Giles scales the quality of the handwriting

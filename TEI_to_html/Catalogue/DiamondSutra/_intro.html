      <p>This English translation of the Diamond Sutra (Sanskrit: Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā
                Sūtra) was made by Lapis Lazuli Texts and can also be found on <a href="http://www.lapislazulitexts.com/tripitaka/T08_0235" target="_blank">their website</a>.
                Lapis Lazuli Texts was started as an original effort aiming to translate a selection
                of important texts from the Chinese Buddhist canon into English. These translations
                are being made for the express purpose of universal free distribution, and may be
                integrated into any collection of texts with little difficulty. Additionally, these
                translations are available in a wide variety of cross-platform formats, such as web
                pages, PDF and DJVU documents, Unicode text files, and machine-readable XML. Due to
                their online format, distribution can continue indefinitely, unencumbered by the
                traditional publishing process.</p>

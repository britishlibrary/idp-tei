              This, the earliest dated manuscript from south China from the Stein collection, already exhibits the principal features of the more numerous supra manuscripts from imperial chancelleries of the Tang dynasty. It is written on very thin paper treated with a yellow preservative (probably the bark of the Amur cork tree, known in Japan as jihads, which protects the paper from insect attack); the characters are of even size and always number seventeen to a column; finally, a neatly set-out colophon at the end (Fig.7), beneath the title and number, gives the date, the donor’s name, that of the temple (in Hubei province) and those of the monks who actually copied out the text. The supra was written out on behalf of the donor’s deceased father. The end of the scroll is cut to form a tab, like the end of a photographic film, for attaching to the wooden stick on which it was rolled; the yellow preservative may have been brushed on as the paper keeps its original pale buff colour in a narrow strip at this point. The writing is noticeably more angular than that of the preceding manuscript, lacking the long horizontal and keeping well clear of the ruled lines of the columns. Nevertheless, some traces of Lishe style are still visible in the weighting of oblique strokes and horizontal to the right. Further advances towards the developed Aisha of the early Tang dynasty can be seen in another version of the same supra, dated to A.D. 561 in the Northern Chou dynasty (Figs. 2, 9). There, although the horizontal strokes still tend to be weighted to the right, the beginning of the stroke may also be accented, with the tip of the brush entering at right angles rather than in line with the stroke as a whole. Eventually in the regular script of the Tang, the brush tip is wholly concealed.<br>
              Although the text is well known from numerous other sources, such a manuscript as this is of great interest for the information it can give us of the movements of Buddhist monks and the centres of translation and sutra-copying, and eventually perhaps also of paper manufacture. The paper is of the finest quality, thin and strong, and must have been made in south China. That made at Dunhuang itself after it was cut off from Chinese supplies is thick and coarse and came in relatively small sheets. It would not have been at all suitable for making into long rolls. This southern origin is confirmed by the colophon, from which we learn that the scroll was copied in Hubei province in south central China. It must thus have survived not only the centuries in the sealed store at Dunhuang, but the long journey there in the first place, probably on the back of a travelling monk.<br>

              斯坦因收集品的寫卷中，作爲有南朝紀年的，它是最早的，卻已经具備了衆多唐代宮廷寫經中所見的主要特徵。經文書寫在經黃色防蟲劑（日本稱之為黃蘗，可以防止紙張被虫蛀）處理過的薄紙上，字體大小一致，每行十七字。卷尾（參見Figs.7）在題名及卷數的左下方有一整齊的題跋，記錄了紀年、供養人名、所在寺院（在今湖北省）以及兩位抄經比丘的名字。本卷是供養者為超度亡父而供奉的經文。卷尾被剪成像膠片尾端一樣的燕尾，以便粘上用來捲卷子的木軸。由於這一窄條沒有染黃，保持了原來紙的淡黃色。與上一寫卷相比，字體明顯失去圓味，也沒有了長長的“橫”劃，文字整齊地寫在界欄內。既便那樣，“斜”或“橫”的右端筆重，這一點多少有隸書的韻味。與初唐時期楷書非常接近的大般涅槃經的另一抄本，年代為北周561年（參見Figs.2，9圖）。 其“橫”的右端仍有筆重的傾向，筆劃的起筆重，有按壓筆尖的痕迹。到了唐代，字體工整，這種筆尖的痕迹則完全消失。<br>
              盡管通過其他種種資料可以知道經文本身，然而從這個寫本我們可以獲得有關佛教僧侶的活動，譯經、寫經的中心地，甚至紙張的製作等非常有趣的信息。本卷所用紙張質地精良，既薄且韌，無疑是出產於中國南方。中原地區中斷供給後，敦煌本地所生産的紙既厚且粗，紙幅也小，不適於製作長卷子。由題跋中所記的書寫於中國南部湖北省看，可以確信此寫本來自南方。因此，該寫本在被封入敦煌藏經洞的數世紀之前，恐怕已經歷了由雲游僧背負著，從最初的製作地到達敦煌這一漫長的旅程。<br>

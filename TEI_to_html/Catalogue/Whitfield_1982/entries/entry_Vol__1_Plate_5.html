              The original narrow wooden roller and method of trimming the end of the scroll can clearly be seen here. The end is pasted onto the roller. The Daoist text is also set out in exactly the same way as Buddhist sutras, from the standard number of seventeen characters to a column, down to the title and colophon at the end. The latter gives, in addition to the date and scribe’s name, the number of sheets used (four) and the editor of the text, followed by an unfilled space for the person who dyed the paper yellow (Zhuang huang ren 裝潢人), and by the title of the bureau in which it was copied. The dye used was probably that obtained from the bark of the Amur cork tree (Japanese: jihads), which acts as an insect repellent. We may presume that the “paper-dyer” was responsible not only for the dyeing of the paper but also for the joining of the separate sheets and their attachment to the roller. The projecting ends of the roller are lacquered dark brown.<br>

              隋大業八年（612）<br>
              紙本墨寫.<br>

              通過圖版可以看到保留下來的原裝細木軸，以及卷尾兩端剪裁方法，卷尾粘貼在卷軸上。從每行十七字、題名以及題跋等書寫方式，可以看出道經寫本與佛經寫本的特徵基本相同。題跋記錄了寫卷的年代、寫經生的名字、用紙數（4）、覆校者姓名，後面有將紙染黃的“裝潢人”，未記錄名字。末行是組織寫經的官署名。染料可能是採用了具有防蟲作用的黃蘗的皮（日文：jihads）。我們可以推測裝潢人不僅負責染紙，而且還負責紙張的粘連以及木軸的安裝。木軸的兩端塗有暗褐色的漆。<br>

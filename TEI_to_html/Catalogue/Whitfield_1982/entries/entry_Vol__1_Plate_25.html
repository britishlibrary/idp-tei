              Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D.<br>
              Ink and colours on silk<br>
              H.88.0 cm, W. 55.0 cm<br>
              Stein painting 48.Ch. xlix.001<br>
              See also Figs.76<br>
              This figure is of great interest since although it is depicted in three-quarter view in very much the same way as some of the paintings of Buddhist Bodhisattvas, even to the gesture of the right hand, this appears to a Christian, perhaps a Nestorian, saint (see also Fig.76). A cross, each arm terminating in bead-like extensions, appears both in the headdress of the figure and hanging form the necklace he is wearing. In his left hand he holds a long staff. He wears a red stole with a yellow lining, over a robe which has faded to a greenish colour very similar to that of the background silk.<br>
              Two minor features suggest that this painting dates from the end of the ninth century: the narrow flame border of the halo and the configuration of the mouth, which has a slight downward return to the ends of the ink line between the lips. Further confirmation of a possible Christian identification of the figure appears on close examination of the face, as there is a fairly thick moustache and a slight beard, both in red and quite different from the curling moustaches, generally in green, of Bodhisattvas such as Pl.13.<br>

              唐代，9世紀<br>
              絹本设色<br>
              高88.0釐米 寬55.0釐米<br>
              斯坦因繪畫48.Ch.xlix.001<br>
              參見Fig.76<br>
              此像如菩薩像中所常見的那樣，為四分之三身像，右手的姿势也很相似，但表現的是基督教，或許是景教的聖者（參見Fig.76）。冠飾和項鏈都有邊緣為水滴狀的十字架。聖者左手持長杖,身披黃色襯裏的紅色披肩，其下著綠色衣服，但已褪色，與背景顔色相近。<br>
              頭光有細小的火焰帶，閉合的唇線拉著墨線，兩端稍往下翻卷。這兩個微小特徵說明此畫是9世紀末以後的作品。細查臉部描寫，相當密的鬍子和稀疏的鄂鬚都是赤茶色的，與彩色圖版第13圖的觀世音菩薩通常捲曲的綠色鬍鬚完全不同，從這一點可肯定此像表現的是基督教聖者。<br>

            妙法蓮華經卷第三<br>
            
              Tang dynasty, dated 3rd year of Xianheng (A.D.672)<br>
              Ink on paper<br>
              H.26.0cm, L. of each sheet 45.7cm<br>
              British Library, Stein 4209<br>
              This scroll of the Lotus Sutra, one of several hundred examples of this text collected by Stein, is also one of a score of sutras written in the imperial chancelleries and dated in the 670s. The paper is of very fine quality, crisp to the touch and of even, opaque yellow-brown colour, besides being still in excellent condition. The ivory knobs at the ends of the roller are stained green and are elegantly turned. They are 3.8 cm long and project 1.5 cm above and below the scroll. This manuscript has lost its original cover and fastening tape; indeed, virtually none of the thousands in the collection have survived intact with their original outer covers. Numbers of covers have, however, been preserved separately; they may be made of a stouter paper or of a doubled sheet of the same quality as used in the manuscript itself and attached by paste to the first sheet of the manuscript, with a narrow bamboo splint pasted in at the beginning. The fastening tape (one example is a narrow strip of silk cut across the weave and folded lengthwise three times) is ingeniously attached by piercing the paper just behind the splint. The tape passes once around the splint and back through the same pierced hole, and through a slit in the tape itself. About 2 cm of the tape is left inside and may be pasted down. The result is a very simple but secure fastening, which remains quite flat and cannot come away from the cover. Once fastened, several scrolls could be kept together in a neat bundle by means of a wrapper. Examples of wrappers have also survived and are found in both the Stein and the Elliot collections (Vol.3, Pls.6, 7; Tissues, Pls.1, 3, 39).<br>
              Wall paintings at Dunhuang show monks reading from sutra scrolls identical to this, while several paintings in London and Paris show a pilgrim with backpack loaded with scores of neatly bundled scrolls (Vol.2, Pl.59). The presence in the sealed library at Dunhuang of great numbers of scrolls written in distant parts of China is clear evidence of the ease with which sutras were transported and propagated from one Buddhist centre to another throughout the empire and beyond. Further study of range of papers found at Dunhuang in their original condition, still strong and serviceable, is needed and should yield much information about such movements and about the paper industry that supplied the very considerable demands of Buddhist and imperial scriptures as well as everyday needs.<br>

              紙本墨寫.<br>

              斯坦因收集品中法華經寫本達數百件，其中一些是670年代唐代宮廷寫經，這個寫卷就是其中之一。紙張極爲精致，手感平滑，呈淡黃色，至今保存狀態仍完好。木軸兩端軸頭嵌象牙，着綠色，極為考究。軸頭長3.8厘米，卷子上下各露出1.5厘米。<br>
              該卷護首和絲帶已失，其實數千件收集品中，沒有一件完整無損地保留著原來的護首，然而卻保留了許多從寫卷上脫落的護首。護首或是用更爲厚實的紙製作的，或是用兩張與寫卷一樣的紙粘合在一起製作的，護首粘在第一張紙上。卷首粘有細竹籤。絲帶（舉一例子，絲帶穿過自身，縱向折三次）巧妙地穿過竹籤後面的紙張。絲帶繞過竹籤後，再從同一紙孔穿出，再穿過絲帶本身的孔。約有2厘米的絲帶被粘在封皮裡面。這種方法非常簡單，但包紮得卻非常緊，相對平整，也不會從封皮脫出。一旦捆好，若干卷可以包成一帙。斯坦因和伯希和收集品中可以見到遺留下來的經帙的樣例（參見第3卷彩色圖版第6，7圖，伯希和圖錄《敦煌絲織品》篇圖版1，3，39）。<br>
              敦煌壁畫中，有描繪僧人誦讀經卷的圖像。斯坦因和伯希和的收集品中,也有若干件是雲遊僧背負裝著經卷的繪畫（參見卷2，圖59）。敦煌藏經洞出土很多抄寫于遙遠中原的經卷，說明佛經很容易從一個佛教中心傳播到另外一個中心，並遍及國內外。進一步研究敦煌出土的現在仍然結實耐用的紙張的原始狀況，不但是必要的，而且還可以提供有關紙的流通以及供應寺院、政府和日常生活所需的造紙工業等更多信息。<br>

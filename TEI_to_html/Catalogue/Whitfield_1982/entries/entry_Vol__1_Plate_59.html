            金剛力士像（整個的幡參見圖28）<br>
            
              Tang dynasty, late 9th century A.D.<br>
              Ink and colours on silk<br>
              H.67.5 cm, W. 18.6 cm<br>
              Stein painting 134.Ch. 004<br>
              This painting has already been shown as a complete banner in Pl. 28 together with the Bodhisattva of Pl. 55. A similar figure in New Delhi (Stein, Serindia, Ch.i.006) is also preserved complete, with only minimal differences such as the mouth being open to show the teeth, and the side streamers blue instead of green. Even the lozenge border at the bottom has the same colours in the same places.<br>
              The fact that this is one of a series of a almost identical figures also emerges when one examines the depiction itself, which is far less vigorous than such an example as Pl. 58. The contrast can be seen in the modelling: although colour shading and ink outlines are used in both paintings, here they are used rather tamely and conventionally, in contrast to the bold effects obtained in Pl. 58. Again, both paintings feature a halo ringed with flames: in many cases such flames simply form a decorative outer border or edging to the halo, but in Pl. 58 they serve to break the geometric outline and appear to be blown by the fury of the figure, now within the circle and now outside it. In the present banner and its match in New Delhi, the flames all lie inside the circles and have lost their vitality. The differences illustrate levels of skill among the painters, since all were very probably executed in the same period of the late ninth century.<br>

              唐代，9世紀末<br>
              絹本設色<br>
              高67.5釐米<br>
              寬18.6釐米<br>
              斯坦因繪畫134.Ch.004<br>
              此幡全圖已經和圖55的菩薩一同刊載在圖28中。與其相似的幡則收藏在新德里國立博物館（斯坦因《西域》，Ch.006），也保存完好。除張口露牙，兩側的幡尾不是綠的而是青色等方面的細微差別外，底部菱形邊緣的顔色和位置均相同。<br>
              事實上，檢視該畫本身即可發現其是大致相同的系列幡畫中的一件。那些像的描繪，與圖58的金剛力士像相比，缺少活力。其不同點首先體現在肉感的表現上。雖然雙方都是用明暗和墨線表現肉感，但本圖的表現卻很雅氣，符合體型，與上一圖力大無比的強悍感成對比。兩者均伴有火焰光，但表現有差異。大多時候，火焰是單獨在頭光的外緣部或者一角上，與此相對，上一圖的金剛力士像中，宛如是被像的威猛所震動，至使內外都有火焰在燃燒。而本圖的像和新德里國立博物館中的相同形式的像，火焰只在圓形裏面，失去了生氣。這些繪畫都被認爲是9世紀後半葉同期製作的，因此這種差別是由畫家個人才能的差距造成的。<br>

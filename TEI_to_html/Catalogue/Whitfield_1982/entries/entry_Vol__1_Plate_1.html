              According to Stein himself, the paintings that he found in the small memorial chapel at Dunhuang, now Cave 17, were in irregularly shaped bundles, some of which, used to level the ground, were at the very bottom and others on the top of the “solid rampart” of manuscript bundles. Because of their compact nature, and because they were almost all sewn up tightly in coarse covers of linen, these bundles of manuscripts by and large suffered less damage than the paintings crushed beneath them. It also seems that some of them date back considerably earlier than the earliest of the paintings.<br>
              As their interest was literary rather than artistic they were placed in the Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books and now form part of the British Library. Nevertheless, in order to present a fair account of the nature of the deposit in Cave 17, and because of their intrinsic interest, it has seemed right to present a small selection here. They have been chosen both to illustrate the development of calligraphic styles and to show the appearance of the scrolls themselves, since these must have been one of the most familiar sights not only at Dunhuang but throughout Buddhist China, as the work of translating sutras and propagating the Buddhist faith was carried on. Many of the finest scrolls were in fact executed not at Dunhuang but at the capital, and the paper on which they were written also came from distant parts of China and is of the highest quality.<br>
              Although not dated, the manuscript shown in this plate is a fine example of the earliest documents found in the sealed library at Dunhuang. Written on a substantial, pale buff paper, the characters are written within ruled columns but exhibit considerable variation in size: often insufficient space has been left for the last character in a column, and the number of characters per column, though usually seventeen, varies between sixteen and nineteen. Features of the script are the very upright verticals, and slender horizontal strokes weighted at the right. Hairline connecting strokes show a basically circular movement of the brush that is also reflected in the curved ends of the oblique strokes and the prevailing gentle upward curve of the horizontal.<br>

              據斯坦因本人的記錄，他在一個小的紀念窟，現在的第17窟裏發現繪畫類作品的時候，它們都很不規則的捆紮在一起，有的鋪在地上，在最下層，有的則堆积在由一捆捆寫卷筑起的“堅固的堡壘”上。因為寫卷是緊緊地卷起來的，而且所有的寫卷都用粗麻布包裹着，所以和被擠壓在下邊的繪畫相比，損壞的程度要低得多。在年代上，最早的寫卷要比最早的繪畫早得多。<br>
              這批寫卷以及美術品作爲文獻要比美術品更引起大家的興趣，所以當時收入大英博物館的東方稿本和刻本部，現在成為大英圖書館的一部分。不過，為了展示敦煌第17窟藏品的性質以及所蘊含的價值，有必要從中選出幾件在此作一介紹。圖版的選擇，既考慮書法形式的發展變化，也考慮寫卷的外觀。因爲這些寫卷不但反映敦煌地區，也能反映全中國廣大地區進行的譯經、寫經及其傳播情況。事實上，許多精品寫卷不是在敦煌而是在首都製作的，書寫的紙張也是取自於中國遙遠的地方，紙質精良。<br>
              本圖所反映的寫本雖然沒有紀年，但是在敦煌藏經洞發現的屬於最早期的優秀寫卷之一。質地優良的淡黃色紙上畫烏絲欄，字書寫在烏絲欄內，字的大小不一，經常是每行最後一字所留空間不足。絕大多數情況下每行字數十七字，但也有十六字至十九字的。字體特徵是，“豎”劃筆直，“橫”的右端筆重。筆畫之間有細微的連筆，筆勢基本呈圓形。從“斜”劃的尖端彎曲挑起，“橫”的中間稍呈隆起等現象上也能看出其特徵。<br>

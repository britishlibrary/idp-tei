              Like Pl.8, this scene depicts the paradise of Sākyamuni with side scenes illustrating the story of Prince Sujāti. Sākyamuni, both hands in vitarka-,or preaching, mudrā, is seated between two Bodhisattvas above a dancer on a platform between two groups of musicians. Below them is the familiar lotus lake with golden islands on which stand a jiva-jiva——or bird with two human heads——on the left, and a kalavinka——with one head——on the right (Fig.38). These occupy only a limited space on either side, and the main part of the foreground is devoted to a second triad with a central Buddha, accompanied by a Bodhisattva and a monk. This Buddha has on his robe various cosmological emblems (Pl.11-3): the sun and moon on either shoulder, Mt. Sumeru on the breast, and to either side of that the figures of a four-armed god and of an ascetic seated on a tripod. Although Eiichi Matsumoto proposed that this Buddha should be identified as Vairocana, it is also possible that he represents Sākyamuni in his cosmic aspect. If so, this would illustrate the main thesis of the Lotus Sutra, in the course of preaching which the Buddha revealed that the master who appeared as Sākyamuni was in fact merely a corporeal manifestation of the eternal Buddha on earth and the embodiment of cosmic truth (cf:Ch’en, 1964, p.380).<br>
              The narrative of the side scenes, taken from the Baoen-sutra, begins at the top of the right margin (Fig.35) with successive scenes following one another and continuing upwards from the bottom of the left margin (Fig.34). The first scene shows the tutelary spirit of the palace appearing to give warning to the impending treachery of the minister Rahula, in revolt against his ruler. A ladder shows the escape of the king, his wife, and little son, Sujāti. At first they have a bag of provisions for their flight, but when these are exhausted Sujāti has to intervene and offer his own flesh to save his mother from being killed for food by the king. On the left, in the third scene, the parents take two of the last three pieces of flesh from Sujati and leave him to continue on their journey alone (Pl.11-4). When they have done so, Sujati gives his last piece of flesh to some wild animals, here represented by a white lion, who finally changes into his true shape as Sakra Devendra (the god Indra) and restores Sujāti to wholeness.<br>
              In style, several features of this painting appear to point to a date in the first half of the ninth century. The composition, although more elaborate than that of Pl.7 which we have seen to be related to early Tang preaching scenes in the wall paintings at Dunhuang, is still far from being as elaborate as those of the later Tang paradise scenes. In particular the architectural setting behind the main Buddha is confined to a single large pavilion, with a verandah just visible on either side. The three principal figures are left free and prominent, to the extent that the two monk figures between them are seen at a lower level, head and shoulders only. This still recalls, although by different means, the prominence given to the Buddha in the embroidery of Sākyamuni Preaching on the Vulture Peak (Vol.3,Pl.1), where the two monks stand behind the Bodhisattvas to leave the Buddha completely free. This uncluttered arrangement means that in front of the platform with the dancer and musicians there is room for the second group with a central Buddha, accompanied by a Bodhisattva and monk.<br>
              In the actual delineation of the figures, the robes hang in smooth and easy curves, undisturbed by sudden twists or turns. The haloes of the various Bodhisattvas and musicians, indeed that of the lower Buddha as well, are chiefly composed of patterns derived from lotus petals and executed in broad outlines. The harder, more geometric lines of later halo patterns can be contrasted to this. Similarly, the facial features and hands, particularly those of the principal figures, are executed with delicacy and subtlety, as well as with care. It is possible to compare a detail such as the face of one of the Bodhisattvas, with a similar face from a later painting (Stein painting 41, dated A.D.939, Vol.2, Pl. 17) in order to appreciate this. In general, the features are contained within the facial outline, although where a figure is in three-quarter view, the line of the upper eyelid may often project beyond the outline. This happens more often, if not invariably, in the paintings of the tenth century.<br>
              The landscapes of the narrative to either side follow a pattern familiar from the cave paintings as well. In general, the scenes seem to be linked in pairs, with a major element, usually a cliff or summit, appearing above the upper scene. Although the technique looks simple, with bands of red and green colour alternating and accented by ink to mark the folds and contours, it is used to advantage. There is often a triangular wedge or repoussoir to create a flat space for the episode, a longer slope set diagonally and returning to separate a pair of scenes, and a group of rocks with a predominantly vertical stance to close with a high horizon before the sequence begins again with a foreground scene on a flat setting. These vertical elements generally incorporate an overhanging cliff. Those at the very top on either side form peaks which are easily read as being larger or more distant, although in fact the trees that grow on them differ not at all from those lower down. The trunks of these trees are set well below the horizon line, while the foliage is silhouetted beyond it. The one building shown here is set at a diagonal, but the wall indicating the capital city of the country of Vārānasī runs straight across. Cartouches for the scenes, coloured red or yellow, alternate on the margins, with the topmost one centrally placed. Unlike in Pl.8, none of the cartouches is actually inscribed, probably because the story would be instantly recognizable and its episodes readily followed from the depiction. The large panel between the two groups of donor figures below (Fig.72) is similarly left blank, and we are left to conjecture whether such a painting was simply held in readiness for a commission, or whether the donor figures had become an essential part of the whole, not to be omitted even when there was no specific donor. Their demure attitudes, kneeling with joined hands, and the broad and slightly limp cap ribbons of the men serve to confirm that this painting dates from shortly before the middle of the ninth century; the donors of Fig.73 (dated A.D.864) are a close comparison.<br>

              與圖8一樣，中央是釋迦牟尼淨土，兩側邊緣是須闍提太子本生故事。釋迦雙手結說法印，於二菩薩中間結跏而坐。其下方舞臺上，一個舞伎在二組樂伎的伴奏下翩翩舞蹈。舞臺下方，左右兩側有常見的蓮池，池中各有金沙島，左側為共命之鳥——一鳥二人頭，右側為迦陵頻伽（參見Fig.38）。然而，兩邊蓮池所占空間很少，前景的主要位置被第二组以菩薩和比丘作脅侍以佛為中心的三尊像所占。佛的袈裟上裝飾著各種宇宙標志（參見圖11－3）：兩肩上的日、月，胸部的須彌山，兩側的四臂神像，以及坐在三足鼎上的苦行者。雖然松本榮一博士提出該佛可以確定為毗盧遮那佛，也可能是象徵釋迦牟尼佛的宇宙觀。如果是这樣，則是描繪《妙法蓮華經》主要思想的。佛在經文中宣說，作為世界之主出現的釋迦牟尼不僅是永恆居世的肉身佛，而且也是宇宙真理的化身（參見Ch’en,1964,p.380）。<br>
              邊緣部位繪的故事來源于《報恩經·孝養品》，由右上方開始（參見Fig.35）依序向下展開，轉到左側時，卻是由下往上展開（參見Fig.34）。第一幅場景是宮殿保護神降臨，警告國王逆臣羅睺起兵叛亂。下方描繪梯子的場面，是國王、夫人和須闍提太子逃离的情景。最初逃離時他們攜有一袋糧食，後来糧盡，國王欲殺夫人而食时，須闍提太子獻出自己身上的肉，解救母親。左側第三幅場景描繪的是，雙親帶著須闍提太子身上最後三塊肉中的兩塊，拋下太子，繼續趕路（參見圖11－4）。他們離去以後，太子将最後的一塊肉給了代表野獸的白色獅子，獅子變回原来的帝釋天形象，使須闍提太子完好如初。<br>
              據其風格上的幾處特徵，可以斷定該繪畫是9世紀上半葉的作品。構圖上，雖然比與敦煌壁畫中初唐時期的說法圖有關係的圖7更精致，但卻遠不及晚唐以後的淨土圖精致。尤其是主尊佛像背後的建築物背景，只限於一棟大型樓閣以及若隱若現的兩側翼廊。主要的三尊主像間，除了下方有僅露出頭和肩的二身比丘外，沒有任何眷屬，十分突出。這使人想起，在刺繡《靈鷲山釋迦說法圖》（參見卷三圖1）中，爲了突出佛陀，而將二比丘安排在菩薩背後站立，從而完全解放佛陀。這樣的安排意味著是為在有樂、舞伎的舞臺前的第二組三尊像一菩薩一比丘及所脅侍的佛留出寬敞的空間。<br>
              聖像的刻畫非常寫實，袈裟没有呈扭曲或反褶，而是緩和流暢地悬垂下來。諸菩薩、樂伎（譯者按：樂伎並無頭光）以及下方的佛的頭光，主要部分用粗線描绘出由蓮瓣派生出的纹樣。這種頭光的表現形式與後來僵硬的、幾何般的線條形成鮮明對比。同樣，對臉部、手部的描繪，特别是在主要像上，非常精致、敏銳、細心。或許也可以用一個菩薩面部細部與後世具有同樣面部特徵的菩薩繪畫（斯坦因繪畫41，年代939年，第2卷，圖17）作一比較，则更容易作出評價。盡管一個畫像面部侧向，出現上眼瞼線比面部輪廓線稍微突出的例子，總的來說，五官收攏于臉部輪廓線內。到10世紀時，突出輪廓線的表現手法更加普遍了。邊緣部分的故事圖中所見的山水表現手法，承襲了石窟壁畫的圖樣。總的來說，主要風景通常都是由出現在上方的斷崖或山脈等組成。盡管技法看似單调，但紅色和綠色帶子交互搭配，用墨描绘出山凹和輪廓，彌補了其缺陷。通常是用三角形或凸形創造一個平面，以便展開故事。一個長坡呈斜對角，然後折回，把兩個故事場面分開。一組岩石呈垂直姿態，構成一個高平面。如此形成層層平面。垂直的岩石一般具體表現為陡峭的懸崖。經常巧妙地运用三角形山脈和岩石作爲分界線。如，左下部迂回的長長的山坡，斷開兩個場景。其上面是不高的山丘鄰接垂直的懸崖，從而劃開了平坦的兩個場景。上面突出的斷崖也起著同樣的作用。繪於左右兩側最上端的山脈，遠遠大於下邊的山，看似是遠處的景色。上边的樹木大小和下邊的無差別，樹雖然從山脊長出，但其葉子極其繁茂，伸到了遠山上。這裡可以看到斜置的建築，代表波羅奈國都城的城墙橫切於畫面上。说明各場面的長方形榜題分別被塗成紅色和黃色，大部分交错分配在左右兩側，只有最上方的左右兩處在中央位置上。與圖8不同，長方形榜題裏没有題字。這恐怕是因爲對該故事非常熟悉，看圖即可很容易瞭解每一場景所講的內容。下方兩組供養人（參見Fig.72）之間大的榜題也是空的，這就使我們推測是因為這是等待定做的绘画，而空置題記欄，或者是假如没有特定的供養人，這種形式也是畫面中不可缺少的重要部分。合掌跪着的供養人端莊的舉止，男供養人的寬而略彎的帽翅等，都能證實該繪畫是9世紀中期稍前的作品。与Fig.73的供養人像（864年）極其接近。<br>

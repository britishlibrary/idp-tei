              Because it has survived almost intact, this banner has already been presented in Pl.28 to introduce the construction of banner paintings. Here it is interesting to note the way in which the painter has approached the problem of showing a figure from the back. The main part of the figure is in three-quarter back view, much as the Bodhisattva of Pl. 49, but with the head turned even further and seen in profile. As occasionally in other Dunhuang paintings, the side view of the face presents a single outline from forehead to mouth, with the nose seen beyond this. The rear view of the shoulders also enables us to see how the hair, seen framing the shoulders of very many Bodhisattvas, divides at the neck into two large locks, falling from a chignon behind the tiara. Other details of the painting similarly reveal the disposition of the robes. The long white scarf in front, so prominent in many of the banners (such as Pl. 56) is just visible, draped over the lotus petals.<br>
              The Bodhisattva holds a glass beaker, evidently moulded and cut in large dimples in the same fashion as that held by the Bodhisattva of Pl. 56, but with an everted instead of an incurved lip, and containing a lotus blossom. Such glass vessels, as explained in the notes to Pl. 56, were probably imports from Iran.<br>

              斯坦因繪畫120，Ch.0025<br>
              此幡基本保留了完整的原型，爲了介紹整體结构，已經在圖28中展示。這裏再次舉出此圖，是想把目光转向畫家描绘像的背面所採用的手法上。圖中的菩薩為四分之三身的背面像，與圖49的菩薩像相似，但頭部還要向后，露出臉的側面。它采用了從額到嘴一筆绘出，其侧向露出鼻子的表现手法，在其他敦煌畫中有時也可看到這種手法。兩肩部分展示的也是背部，所以可看清在其他繪畫中常見的覆蓋菩薩兩肩的頭髮，實際上是從寶冠後面的髮髻垂落的，在頸項處分成兩大缕。其他細節部分，也顯現出了衣服的表現。在多數幡畫中明顯的長而白的綬帶（例如，參照下一圖的菩薩像），在此畫中仅仅搭在蓮華座上。<br>
              此菩薩右手持琉璃缽，與下一圖菩薩所捧的器皿一樣有大波紋的彫飾。只是器形不像下一圖那樣邊口內縮，而是向外側敞開，內插有蓮花蕾。這種玻璃容器，正如下一圖的解說中所述，大概是從伊朗引進的。<br>

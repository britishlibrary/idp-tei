              Tang dynasty, 9th century A.D.<br>
              Ink and colours on silk<br>
              H.77.5 cm, W. 19.0 cm<br>
              Stein painting 92. Ch. xx. 008<br>
              As Aki Uyeno has pointed out (1970,p.12), the floral border on the triangular headpiece, actually a continuation of the same silk as the main scenes, corresponds with that of Pl.31.Like that painting, this one originally was furnished with brown silk streamers, now separately preserved. The colouring of the landscape-dividing motifs, also, suggests that this painting formed part of the same series as Pls. 31 and 33, and that the subject is again the life of the prince. In this cave the top scene represents Sākyamuni’s father, Suddhodana, sending out a messenger to find his son. In the centre the messenger is seen galloping through the hills on his quest, reporting back empty-handed below. This last scene also features musicians to represent some of the pleasures of palace life, and an enclosed garden with lotus tank, bamboo and pavilion (with an unidentified object, perhaps a casket or a dais, inside) to represent its amenities.<br>
              Throughout the painting the white pigment has suffered considerable loss, but otherwise the colours are strong and well preserved.<br>

              唐代，9世紀<br>
              絹本設色<br>
              高77.5釐米 寬19.0釐米<br>
              斯坦因繪畫92.Ch.xx.008<br>
              正如Aki Uyeno 指出的那樣(1970,p.12)，三角形幡頭上的花邊，事實上就是主要場景的同一絹的延續。與圖31的幡一樣，就像圖畫中的一樣，這個最先飾有棕色絲帶，現在被單獨存放著。這個山水畫分割主題的顔色，暗示了這畫構成了象圖31、33同屬一個系統，而且這個主題又是王子生活的一部分。這個洞的頂部場景代表釋迦牟尼的父親淨飯王派出使者尋找他的兒子，在中間場景可以看見使者在山丘上到處急馳,不斷尋找，下面是使者空手而歸彙報情況。最後一個場景仍然以樂師爲特征表現宮廷生活的歡愉，一個有蓮花池的院子，竹和亭子(內有不明物，也許是小箱或者講臺)以表現它的環境。<br>
              通觀整體畫面，白色顔料已經脫落很多，但其他色彩保存良好。<br>
